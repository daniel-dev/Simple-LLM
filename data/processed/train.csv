"this movie could be used in film classes in a how not to script a bmovie course. there are inherent constrictions in a bmovie budgets are tight, time is precious scarecrow was apparently shot in 8 days and the actors are often green and inexperienced. the one aspect you have complete control over is writing the best script you can within the limitations set before you. scarecrows script seems to have been written in a drunken haze. i could go through about fifteen examples of the nonsensical scripting of this movie, but ill just mention one the gravedigger. the character of the gravedigger is introduced about an hour into the movie. he seemingly has no connection to any of the other characters already in the movie. he is shown with his daughter, who also has no connection to anybody else in the movie. the gravedigger is given a couple scenes to act surly in and then is killed to pad out the body count. why give the gravedigger a daughter? why give the daughter a boyfriend? why introduce them so late in the movie? why not try to make them part of the ongoing storyline? scarecrow doesnt seem to care.br br the story of scarecrow goes something like this lester is a high school kid played by and actor whod id peg to be in his early 30s who is picked on by the other kids. he is an artist who draws birds and has a crush on a classmate named judy. his mom is a lush and the town whore. one of her reprobate boyfriends makes fun of his drawings by calling him a faggot for drawing birds instead of monsters and cowboys. if you have a high school student still drawing cowboys id think him to more likely be gay than a high school student who draws crows and later, kills lester, in a cornfield, under the titular scarecrow. magically, lesters soul goes into the scarecrow. somehow, this transference changes lesters soul from that of an artist into that of a wisecracking gymnast i know some reviews have called the scarecrow a kungfu scarecrow. i disagree. the scarecrow practically does a whole floor routine before jumping onto the truck during the climax of the movie. the scarecrow then goes on to kill those who tormented him, those who smoke pot in the corn field, those who dig graves, boyfriends of daughters of gravediggers, pretty much anyone who showed up on the movie set.br br the bonus feature on the dvd should be mentioned. the director a frenchman does an impromptu version of rap music, admits he enjoys not having executives around on set so he can screw his wife while working and gives a quote to live by and im paraphrasing life ez a bitch, but et has a great assbr br number of beers i drank while watching this movie 5 did it help no number of beers needed to enjoy this movie whatever it takes to get to blackout drunk level.",0,2765,505
"prom night is about a girl named donna brittany snow who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. and by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. br br now before i begin let me say have you been tired of pg13 horror movies that havent been scary lately. are you tired of stupid girl dialog oh my god and talking about girlish things. and are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. and the last thing are you tired of the us remaking asian, japanese, and chinese films. that pretty much sums up prom night but im still not done with the review.br br the only reason to see prom night is to crack a laugh at the kills. if not, dont see prom night. you never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. and by the way the deaths are repeating like 247. so not only arent they scary but its obnoxious. by the time i met the cast i think i was ready to hurl. too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of oh my gosh. its our prom. i understand its fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. br br if i were to put prom night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films id be the first one too. im not going to be surprised if it gets released on dvd for cheap and quick. seriously dont spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a night to die for when watching the film.br br 1 star out of 10. p.s. if i could give the film zero stars i would.",0,1501,305
"when i first saw the trailer for prom night, i have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. so my friend and i saw prom night last night and i have to say i must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention i am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. there was no tension, the characters, how was i supposed to care about them? they had no development whatsoever, the killer?! oh, my god, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, i know its a film, but why would a man who neveror at least we know of killed any one before, kill a girls family and friends that hes just obsessed over? i mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? i have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.br br donnas family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. its been 3 years and shes just now getting some peace in her life, shes even going to her senior prom. but the killer has escaped and still has donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employees are. donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses unnoticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.br br im sorry, i really did want to love this movie, we havent had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that i was not impressed with. just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. i know that this was a pg13 movie, but i just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? not to mention no stab holes? i wouldnt recommend this movie for anyone unless youre a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but i dont understand how anyone could.br br 210",0,2287,445

"i was disgusted by this movie. no it wasnt because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi. this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. it shows one piece of art work that she did judith beheading holofernese but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trial.br br i dont know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, tassi was not a noble character. he raped artemisia. it was not love, it was rape. he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured. according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again its true.br br i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about. dont base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie. i encourage you to do some research, artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work.br br dont see the movie, but find out the true story of artemisia.",0,1166,217

"i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented. i mean, i hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a little. groundbreaking is a little over the top. this is a boston based college production that doesnt even achieve the level of most amateur college film. its what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. a silly action film without much creativity. its pretty funny if youre willing to poke fun at it. not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college.",0,651,122
"the good earth is perhaps the most boring film ive seen in my life. the plot is slow and lacking. the acting is borderline comical. while i love paul muni, i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice. the only saving grace i found with this film is its production value. the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time. other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film.",0,631,115

"this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation. on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on. the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved. she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened. the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer. then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell. the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just cant put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that. the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind. this movie reminds me of the lowbudget thriller blood song with frankie avalon staring in it, the same motive just a different character part. its not a movie worth renting not even for an 80s lowbudget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back!",0,1720,334

"you may want to know up front that i am not a mormon, unlike a good number of those who have already reviewed this film. i mention this so youll understand that the way i look at the film may differ greatly from those in the faith. for some, being critical of the film might be seen as being critical of the faithand that is not my intention. so, my review is that of an outsider trying to look inside and learn more about who this man and his people were. well, after seeing the film, i doubt if i have learned much at all. since i have been a history teacher, i have a good basic understanding about young as well as joseph smith as well as the teachings of the church. but anyone wanting to see this film to really learn anything will probably be disappointed because the film seems so goshdarn nicetoo nice and too unrealistic in its portrayal. plus, you learn practically nothing about the churchs beliefs other than they are nice people, work hard and some have many wives and this latter part is only barely hinted at in the film. instead, the people are almost cartoonlike in their simplistic portrayals. joseph smith and brigham young and their followers are angelic, the nonmormons were all devils and brian donlevy playing exactly the same sort of role edward g. robinson later played in the ten commandments is the troublemaker who claims to be a mormon but just comes along so the film can have a bad guy. its all so very simple....too simple. almost like an indoctrination film or infomercial.br br brigham young especially was a very complex manwith many good points an excellent organizer and visionary as well as bad dont even get me started on his views about blacks within the church or intermarriage. to portray him in such vague terms is just plain silly. its also a lot like how gandhi was portrayed in the film with ben kingsleyonly the facts that led to his being almost superhuman were emphasized. heck, now that i think about that, this is the trouble with most religious filmsthey often come off as onedimensional, trite and bland. lets have a full and more complete film of these menone that will stick to facts and not emotional appeals.br br now if you can ignore the fact that you wont learn very much about the faith or its second leader, the film is enjoyable enough. its obvious someone at 20th centuryfox really cared about the film, as they had a wonderful cast of both premier actors tyrone power, up and coming actors linda darnell, jane darwell and vincent price and wonderful character actors dean jagger, john carradine and brian donlevy. the film also had wonderful location shooting and lots of gloss. it just didnt have a lot to tell us other than they were all swell. plus, there were plenty of factual errors and a few just plain dumb scenes. a few of the mistakes include young taking over the helm immediately after the death of joseph smith it was three years later, no mention of the various mormon denominations and splinter groups, talk of gold in californiaeven though it was 1847 and gold wouldnt be discovered until 1948, as well as no specific mention of polygamy or smiths many wives. just plain dumb scenes include carradine pulling out a gun and waving it about in the courtroom sceneand no one seemed to careeven though it was a very hostile audience! dont you think at least the judge would tell him to put it away and stop threatening people with it?!br br one final comment. do not, i repeat, do not watch this film when its shown on american movie classics a one great station that has sunk a lot in recent years. while i am critical of the film because of its simplistic message, i was horrified with the complete disrespect the station had for the church and its traditions. what i mean is this. the film was punctuated with ads for penis enlargement formulas as well as tons of popups some advertising a show that features the sexiest cast. talk about disrespectful and gross and i would be just as offended if they did this for any other religious film. by doing this, they not only insult the faith but marginalize their marketafter all, who is into hearing about these things and the life of brigham young?! is this a movie, in this form, that you can show to your kids or recommend to others?!",0,4264,768

"creep is the story of kate potente, an intensely unlikeable bourgeois bitch that finds herself somehow sleeping through the noise of the last underground train, and waking up to find herself locked in the tube station. after somehow meeting workmate and wouldbe rapist guy on a mystery train that runs after the lines have closed, things go awry and she finds herself pursued by what lurks beneath the citys streets. her story is linked to that of george blackwood, an excon working in the sewer system they meet in the final third of the film, brought together by their attempts to escape the monster that pursues them.br br the pair proceed through a set of increasingly unlikely locations from the tube station, they end up in the sewage works before somehow finding themselves in some sort of abandoned underground surgery. most tube stations dont have toilets, so how one has a surgery is beyond me. naturally, the film cares to explain that the surgery doesnt have running water. yet it has electricity? just one of many inconsistencies that work against the atmosphere of everyday believability that the film tries to create.br br the monster itself is a problem. theres a complete lack of reasoning for its actions, it just kills people for no obvious reason. and then of course it keeps some alive for no real reason either, perhaps just so that they can eventually escape and give the film an extra 15 minutes or so running time. i understand that natural evil is supposed to be scary, but then the film attempts to explain itself via a photo of a doctor and his son, and a few shots of some jars containing babies, and yes, it is just as tired and pathetic as it sounds. it also fails to explain how the creature has been underground long enough to lose the ability to speak, communicating only in raptor screams, but not long enough for its pair of shorts to decay. hmm.br br this doctor business leads to scene that is the films desperate attempt to implant itself on your memory, and while it is gory and uncomfortable to watch, it just isnt enough. the final third of the film hinges on an emotional relationship that never existed, and the characters break down and recover for little or no obvious reason. george breaks down, unable to cope with something despite stating that he wants to escape so he can see his daughter again, and kate becomes emotionally tough seconds after going to pieces over someone that ripped her off for a travelcard. yeah.br br after starting out as a this could happen to anyone movie, it quickly falls apart as it introduces ideas that make it more and more unrealistic. a complete lack of emotional interest in the characters and an absence of suspense make this one to avoid.",0,2725,479

"theres not a drop of sunshine in the sunshine boys, which makes the title of this alleged comedy neil simons sole ironic moment. simon, who adapted the script from his play which goes uncredited, equates old age with irrational behaviorand, worse, clumsy, galumphing, meanspirited irrational behavior. walter matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner george burns for a television special its said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question how long did vaudeville last, anyway?. burns, who won a supporting oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. the noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. director herbert ross only did solid work when he wasnt coupled with one of neil simons screenplays here, ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off such as semiincoherent matthau showing up at a mechanics garage to audition for a tv commercial. at this point, matthau was still too young for this role, and he overcompensates by slouching and hollering. it was up to ross and simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give the sunshine boys some sunniness, yet walter continues to project as if wed all gone deaf. the picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace one loses hope for it early on. 12 from",0,1513,257

"prom night is a titleonly remake of the 1980 slasher flick that starred jamie lee curtis and leslie nielsen. this movie takes place in an oregon town, where donna brittany snow is about to go to her senior prom and let herself have some fun after going through some extremely traumatic events in the past few years. she and her friends arrive at the prom, which is taking place in a grand hotel, and try and enjoy what is supposed to be the most fun night of their lives. little does anyone know, a man from donnas past, who has haunted her for years, is also at the prom... and is willing to kill anyone in way of his pursuit of her.br br im a fan of the original prom night, so i tried to maintain a little hope in this movie, but i have to admit i was quite disappointed. prom night suffers from the worst affliction a horror movie could have, and that is predictability. there are absolutely no surprises here, and i felt i had seen everything in this movie done dozens of times, often better, before. what does this equate to for the audience? boredom. unless of course you have never seen any horror movies, or are part of the preteen crowd, but the majority of the audience will most likely be able to guess nearly everything that is going to happen. the plot is simplistic, but the entire script is void of any type of surprise, twist, atmosphere, or anything, and this really, really hurts the movie because it never really gives the audience anything to sink their teeth into. it all just seemed very bland.br br a lot of people seem to complain with the fact that this is a pg13 slasher movie as well, and i understand what they are saying, but i dont think its impossible to make a good slasher movie with minimal gore. take carpenters halloween for example little to no on screen violence, but still an extremely frightening and effective movie. you dont need gore to make a film scary, but even had prom night been gratuitously violent which it is not, it is very tame, it still would have added little to the movie because there is not much in the script to build on to begin with. the tension and suspense here is mild at best, and i spent most of the movie predicting the outcome of situations, and was correct about 99 of the time. our characters arent well written enough either for the audience to make any connection to them, and their bythenumbers demises are routine and careless.br br i will point out a few things i did like about this movie, though, because it wasnt completely useless the cinematography is really nice, and everything was very wellfilmed and fairly stylish. among the jump scares that are for the most part very predictable, there were a few that were kind of clever. the sets for the movie are nice too and the hotel is a neat place for the plot to unfold, however predictable the unfolding may be. as for the acting, its mediocre at best. brittany snow plays the lead decently, but really the rest of the cast doesnt show off much talent. johnathan schaech plays the villain, and is probably the most experienced performer here, but even he isnt that impressive. however, i did like the character he played, which was a nice change from the typical maskedstalker type killer we see a lot. as far as the ending goes, the last fifteen minutes of the film had me bored to my wits end and it was very anticlimactic.br br overall, prom night was a disappointment. everything was very bythenumbers, routine, and predictable, which is somewhat upsetting considering this had the potential to be a decent slasher movie. there were a few neat moments, but the movie lacked any suspense or atmosphere, and had little plot development, nor believable characters. id advise seasoned horror fans to save their money and wait till its out on video, or rent the original instead, because there are absolutely no surprises here. some may find a little entertainment in it, but it was far too predictable for my tastes. i expected better, and left the theater very disappointed. 310.",0,4012,722

"this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. there are two routes to take in horror films either you dont really explain whats going on or who the killer is, like in texas chainsaw massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained halloween could potentially be an example of this.br br unfortunately, creep fails in this area. i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. no character is fully realized, although the circular nature of kates character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.br br in the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty filmmaking that drag down the film.br br this film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never be great. the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters, story, direction, and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.br br creep does serve a purpose as a mindless, silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, thats about it...",0,1396,246

"scarecrow is set in the small american town of emerald grove where high school student lester dwervick tim young is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers fellow students alike. the poor kid suffers daily humiliation, bullying, teasing general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers. unfortunately he doesnt find much support at home since his mom is a slut after lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field strangles the poor kid. however something magical happens no, the film doesnt suddenly become good, lesters spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him made his life hell...br br cowritten, coproduced directed by emmanuel itier who according to the imdb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called mr. duforq although i dont remember any character of this name, i suppose anyone who ends up looking at the imdb pages for scarecrow will probably already be aware of its terrible reputation i have to say it pretty much well deserved since its terrible. the script by itier, bill cunningham jason white uses the often told story of one of lifes losers who gets picked upon tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick. weve seen it all before, weve seen killer scarecrows before, weve seen faceless teens being killed off onebyone before, weve seen one of lifes losers get his revenge before, weve seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before weve seen incompetent small town sheriffs make matters even worse before. the only real question to answer about scarecrow is whether its any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? the answer is a resounding no to be honest. the film has terrible characters, awful dialogue, an inconsistent predictable story, it has some cheesy oneliners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he asks can you dig it? the socalled twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame. the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isnt that exciting the kills are forgettable. you know im still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed killed with a stick of corn...br br director itier doesnt do a particularly good job here, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means theres never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. also im not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these backflips somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in the matrix 1999 or some japanese kungfu flick! to give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad oneliners twirl around a bit. dont you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? i know hes a killer scarecrow but i still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day! theres no nudity the gore isnt anything to write home about, theres a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in peoples heads, someone has their heart ripped out someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth.br br with a supposed budget of about 250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days, well at least they didnt waste any time on unimportant things like story character development. technically this is pretty much point, shoot hope for the best stuff. if you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing... the acting sucks, the guy who played lesters mums bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous dont get me started on his accent...br br scarecrow has a few fun moments the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special makeup effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable very cheesy. if you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out scarecrows 1988. not to be confused with the gene hackman al pacino film scarecrow 1973 or the upcoming horror flick scarecrow 2008 which is currently in production. scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, scarecrow slayer 2003 scarecrow gone wild 2004.",0,4689,826

"if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless, one might well refer to ned kelly as an australian western. for the people down under, ned kelly was, apparently, a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood, jesse james, bonnie and clyde, and butch cassidy and the sundance kid. the descendant of irish immigrants, kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer, a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison. to get back at the government for this mistreatment, kelly, his brother dan, and two other companions, became notorious bank robbers, winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country.br br perhaps because weve encountered this gentleman bandit scenario so many times in the past, ned kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genres stereotypes and clichs on its way to the inevitable showdown. ned is the typical heartofgold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and, even then, only with the deepest regret. he also has the pulse of the common folk, as when, in the middle of a bank robbery, he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers, after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it. what movie on this particular subject hasnt featured a scene like that? its acts of selective generosity like this, of course, that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powersthatbe and the status quo. geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment. theres even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers, so turned on is she by the romantic derringdo of the criminal lifestyle. and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another.br br heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role, providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging. it doesnt help that he has been forced to provide a droning voiceover narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film.br br ned kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history, but as an entertainment, its just the same old story told with different accents.",0,2672,458

"in what would be his first screenplay, based on his own short story turn about, william faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and really strange relationships. the story originally was about only the tone, young, and cooper characters, but mgm needed to put joan crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract, and faulkner obliged by creating a female role. crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her costars young and tone, leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraphlike shorthand that sounds like a monty python sketch wuthering heights performed in semaphore. seriously, the almost entirely pronounless sentences make ernest hemingway read like henry james.br br the film also reflects some familiar faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister as may be found in his sanctuary, and elsewhere. when young proposes to crawford, in tones presence, in lieu of an engagement ring all three exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. the closeness of tone and young is also noticeable, especially as they go off to their thelma louise fate. frankly, its creepy.br br not as creepy to this new yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, wellington, which crawford cheerfully catches and which is shown gamboling over her handsi had to turn away! and young turns into a gladiator. blech.br br that being said, there are some nice performances. young is particularly engaging in a scene where hes taken up in coopers fighter plane, and roscoe karns is delightful as coopers flying buddy. tone, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy youngs fate. crawford, stripped of meaningful dialogue as well, mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic, which is quite a balancing act for one role.br br the battle scenesnot surprisingly, for a howard hawks filmare the most exciting part of the entire picture. but not enough. as far as im concerned, this is 75 minutes of my life im never going to get back.",0,2180,354
"paul armstrong is a liberal, scottishborn, professor of law at harvard, known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty, who is hired to take on the case of bobby earl, a young black man from florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of joanie shriver, an eleven year old white girl. earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is blair sullivan, a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders. armstrong visits sullivan in his cell on death row, hoping to persuade him to confess to joanies murder, thereby saving earl from the electric chair. br br at first all goes well. sullivan confesses and earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction. as this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film, it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer. warning! major plot twist ahead! and so it proves. the anticipated twist soon materialises. earl, it transpires, is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted, and probably of several others as well, but hatched a diabolical plan together with sullivan in order to secure his freedom sullivan will confess to joanies murder if earl will murder his parents. just why sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained. armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved earl has a grudge against armstrongs wife, herself a lawyer, who acted as counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when earl was accused of rape. br br just cause is an example of the autocannibalism in which hollywood sometimes likes to indulge, cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others. the first half owes an obvious debt to films like intruder in the dust and to kill a mockingbird about the only difference is that the sheriff who beats a confession out of bobby earl is himself black, whereas in earlier films he would have been white. police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity. the central twist in the plot was borrowed from costagavrass music box, although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end. the finale, in which a lawyer, his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client, is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of cape fear, which also take place in the swamplands of the american south. ed harris characterisation of sullivan as a biblequoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of robert de niros character in the scorsese version of cape fear, made four years before just cause. br br there is a postscript. just as just cause borrowed heavily from several other movies, seven years later its central plot twist was, in its turn, to be blatantly plagiarised in the ashley judd vehicle high crimes. br br the trouble with this style of filmmakingbynumbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them. the whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts, and just cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it. harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances, largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de niro playing max cady. blair underwood is ok as bobby earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes, but unconvincing as bobby earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones. sean connery as armstrong and laurence fishburne as the black sheriff are rather better, but neither is good enough to save the film. connery and harris were to act together in another, better, film, the rock, the following year. br br there is another problem with just cause. the first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie, antideath penalty, antiracist and critical of heavyhanded policing. the second half looks more like the work of a diehard reactionary, preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards, that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair, that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes. the filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably unwanted effect of reversing its political stance, or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it. a suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency. 410",0,4691,811

"the main reason people still care about carltonbrowne of the f.o. is that it features peter sellers in a secondbilled role. but watching this film to see peter sellers is a mistake.br br sellers plays amphibulos, a vaguely reptilian prime minister of the dirtpoor island nation of gaillardia, formerly a british colony, now hosting a lot of russian diggers during the height of the cold war. amphibulos wants to play both u.k. and soviet interests against each other for easy profit, everything very friendly and all our cards under the table. terrythomas is the title character, a lazy british diplomat anxious to show gaillardia that great britain hasnt forgotten them, all appearances to the contrary.br br a positive review here says the reason this movie is considered average is because the comedy is understated. i would argue that the reason carltonbrowne is considered below average is because the comedy is nonexistent.br br after a decent opening that establishes the films only two strengths, a sympathetically doltish terrythomas and john addisons fullon larky score, things quickly slow down into a series of slow burns and lame miscommunication jokes. the low opinion of carltonbrowne by his boss and the obscurity of gaillardia which no one can find on a map is milked to death. by the time we actually reach the island after a labored series of airsick jokes, expectations are quite low.br br theyre still too high, though. the island itself, which seems to exist either in latin america or the mediterranean, is so pathetic its honor guard faints at the airport, and the review stand falls apart in the middle of a parade. the army is apparently still horse drawn, allowing for another lame aural gag by a thickaccented announcer in war, the army uses many horse.br br sellers never quite takes center stage even when were on his characters island. the plot is taken over instead by ian bannen as king loris, who inherits the throne of gaillardia after his fathers assassination. bannen is dull and plays his part as straight as it is written. normally this would make him the likely target for scenestealing by sellers, but trapped behind a thick accent and greasy moustache, sellers is only a threat to those of us who remember him far more happily in two other films made this same year, the mouse that roared and im all right, jack.br br strange that this film, like jack, was a boulting brothers production, with roy boulting here serving as codirector alongside jeffrey dell. usually boulting films combine wicked social satire with anythinggoes comedy, but here there are only fey jabs in either direction. amphibulos works his mangledenglish vibe for all its worth this man is like, how do you say, the bull in the chinese ship while carltonbrowne is generally ragged on by his superior far more than he seems to deserve.br br the weakest and most protracted element of the film is young loriss romance with ilyena. score one point for her being played by ravishing luciana paluzzi, dock one for the fact that they are apparently cousins is never addressed.br br the film winds up with a lamely staged revolution whose surprise resolution will surprise no one, and a final bit of action by carltonbrowne that would seem to nail the lid on his coffin literally. apparently he lives to see another day, but the film of the same name is strictly doa.",0,3373,573

"there seems to be little in the way of middle ground where watch on the rhine is concerned. one either likes it very much, applauding its sincerity, its liberal point of view and fine acting, or else loathes its obvious propaganda, mediocre dialogue, cardboard characters and overall tendentiousness. i fall very much in the latter category, and found the film and play,concerning the activities of european refugees in washington during wartimea crushing bore, worthwhile mostly for the acting, and even then only intermittently. that author lillian hellman was on the side of the angels is irrelevant. her plays were written for people who shared her point of view, and she seldom explored ideas that werent already held by the author and audience except to point out how dreadful the other side is. even when i find myself in one hundred percent agreement with what she has to say,as in rhinei still cant stand the way she says it. her characters are unreal, and while her ear for dialogue shows a certain facility for the way people talk she possesses no real brilliance or originality. she really had nothing new to say. i thoroughly agree with the late mary mccarthys long overdue dismantling of hellman reputation some years ago. for those who think the theatre is dead or in extremis and yearn for the good old days, i urge a peek at watch on the rhine, as bad in its way as angels in america, which only goes to show that the theatre had one foot in the grave sixty years ago.",0,1485,261
"fever pitch isnt a bad film its a terrible film.br br is it possible american movie audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that theyll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs? thats the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy and i use that term loosely because theres nothing funny in this film is getting good reviews.br br i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny.br br the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film. he adapted fever pitch for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in 1997 peter hedges found hornbys voice for about a boy 2002 and when high fidelity was americanized for a movie in 2000, writers d.v. devincentis, steve pink, john cusack and scott rosenberg didnt go wrong because they kept the essence of hornbys wit and humor. they made one of the best films of that year.br br so why does the american version of fever pitch go so painfully awry? the british version wasnt a masterpiece, but it was charming, funny, unexpected and gave us two characters we could like, respect and understand.br br but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornbys work. in americanizing the story, theyve butchered it, removing all that was good and unique about hornbys work and replacing it with conventional drivel.br br theyve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy, never once veering from the wretched formula. lindsey drew barrymore has three girlfriends, each of whom has a distinct function. ones overweight, the seconds cynical and ambitious, and the thirds a romantic. want to guess how many male friends ben jimmy fallon has?br br what made high fidelity such fun was not only a good leading man and lady, but engaging supporting characters. in this fever pitch, the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny. theyre so insignificant, theyre not even decorative. the only reason theyre in the film is because the formula demands it. poor ione skye winds up as one lindseys pals in a thankless role. the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away. come to think of it, cusack wouldve made an excellent ben. of course, cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script.br br there isnt a single, solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced. every plot turn is predictable, every lame joke telegraphed. ganz and mandel labor for laughs. the first 45 minutes are so excruciatingly slow, you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy. you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch. its almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing gurus formula pasted on the wall. when they got to a certain page, they looked up at the formula and said, ok, the guru says this has to happen now. and, presto!br br directors bobby and peter farrelly dont help the film any. they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters they hand over the v.o. narration not to the protagonist, but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park. thanks to some extremely clunky writing, we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings.br br barrymore does cute and adorable better than most. shes as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday. but even her cuteness cant save this extraordinarily awful film. she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story. about 30 minutes into the film, lindsey tells ben, youre funny. the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script. for fallons ben never says anything even remotely funny. fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy, he overacts.br br fallon was never any good on saturday night live. he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show. remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices? the only reason weekend update worked occasionally was because fallons cohort, tina fey, knows a thing or two about comedy.br br actors who think theyre funny and behave that way rarely, if ever, are actually funny. thats true of fallon. he thinks hes hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle. his stuttering, unsureofhimself shtick didnt work on the small screen its lousier on the big screen.br br unfortunately for fallon, his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments. if you thought his comedy was bad, wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff. two scenes in particular the first in a park, the second in front of bens school are painful to watch. the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability, but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work. his range of emotions doesnt even run the gamut from a to b.br br ben has no personality or depth. often, he comes across as an oaf. and not a lovable one at that. it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him. compare fallons performance to firths in the british version, and youll understand how terribly flat, unfunny and forced fallons ben is and how wrong he is for this role. watching fallon in fever pitch makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher!br br just as high fidelity did, an americanized fever pitch couldve worked brilliantly. it just needed better writers, more competent directors and, most definitely, a stronger, funnier, smarter leading man. do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the 1997 british version and read hornbys book, instead.",0,5687,988
"i wish i could give this movie a zero out of ten. before going to this movie the day after it came out, i came on imdb to check out the comments. a comment called the movie predictable and cheesy with terrible dialog. i never go by other peoples opinions, so i wasted seven dollars for this crap movie. it had to be one of the worst movies ive ever seen.br br the person who wrote the script should be pushed off a cliff. since when do scary movies have sappy scenes? i swear, im amazed there werent any group hug moments.br br i think i jumped. once. and thats because i zoned out, thinking about my research paper for english. the clichd, birdscat popping out of nowhere thing when you thought something was gonna happen.br br and the characters were stupid. my friend and i almost died laughing when the alarm went off and the main character said, i have to get my moms shawl!!! you. idiot. screw the shawl! safety is just a few steps away, but no, my moms shawl that didnt match the dress by the way is wayyyy more important than my health and safety. and to top it all off, they take her back to her house, knowing that the killer knew where she lived. god.br br my friend and i also predicted the entire movie. and not just the, i bet hes hiding under the bed, moments. it was the, he stole the bellhops clothes and sneaked out of the hotel and its the detective coming down the hallway, not the killer! moments. movies should never be this predictable. disney movies arent even this predictable.br br im gonna complete my rant now by saying, this was a terrible movie. im glad i went to see it in theaters so i wouldnt buy it for 15.00 and then hate it. it was just bad. it wouldve been better if only one thing wouldve happened. if, after being shot by the detective, the killer would have fallen down in the same position he got shot in. knife in hand, falling and stabbing the girl on his way down. oh, how lovely that wouldve been.br br dont waste your time or money. go see a good movie.",0,1999,381

"i honestly believe that anyone considering filmmaking be subjected to this mindboggling failure. like the films of edward wood, jr. in the 60s and 70s, this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers expend so much energy rewriting scripts, reediting their films, and reworking their special effects until they finally look right. this movie is also a decent argument for the studios prescreening process. if mr. hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an impartial audience, perhaps he would have cut 75 or the walkingrunningstrolling scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes.br br film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be. every performance, every line of dialog, every digital effect, every filter effect, indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of striving for mere mediocrity. a beginning filmmaker may find himselfherself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself. this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out.br br critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever made.br br beginning writers can learn from this film just how important rewrites are, and perhaps understand the necessity for rewrites. also, beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay, and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story. writers and directors who watch bad madeforcable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results.br br i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers. particularly those entering the craft in this current postlucas and postspielberg environment. there is a reason filmmakers such as these are hailed for their ability with special effects. the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off. some cant even come close to it.",0,2231,370

"swing! is an important film because its one of the remaining blackproduced and acted films from the 1930s. many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. its also a nice chance to see many of the talented black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old cotton cluba time all but forgotten today.br br unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, its also a mess. the main plot is very similar to the hollywood musicals of the eraincluding a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. however, the writing is just godawful and a bit trashy at timesand projects images of black america that some might find a bit demeaning. this is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a noaccount bum who lives off his hard working wife a popular stereotype of the time and when he is caught with a hussy who, by the way, totally overplays this role, they have a fight which looks like a scene from wwe smackdown! and, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razora trashy scene indeed! later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! it seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience plus they cant even do this wellwith some of the worst acting ive seen in a very long time.br br still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing, this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancingas well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten black culture. just dont say i didnt warn you about the actingits really, really bad!",0,1879,343

"is it possible to give a movie no stars? i suppose not. however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and youll get my drift. director and photographer timothy hines didnt have much of a budget compared to spielbergs herculean effort with the same material rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made, but that need not be an insurmountable handicap. ive seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring soldier and saints is a recent example. with hard work, integrity and, above all, talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells novella and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its war of the worlds. unfortunately, hines failed in all these departments. even if he had had spielbergs budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal hes foisted on us.br br primarily, hines seems unable to tell a story. thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound, but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records. a guy walks down a country lane, a lot. he talks badly aped received english to some other guy. then he walks down the same lane, only shot from the back this time to show hes returning clever, eh? walking and talking, for nearly an hour thats all that happens. ok, ill grant that one extended excursion from the main characters house to the impact site on horsell common to show that its a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful a firstyear film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this, btw, but half a dozen times? back and forth, back and forth, et cetera, et cetera with some yakkityyak in between. remarkable. the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a featurelength film. finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking, or shrieking. later we get staggering and wailing for dessert.br br thankfully, much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h.g. wells text else wed have no idea what is going on. but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text, to realize what words alone cant convey? if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel, why bother? why not do a radio play? orson welles made himself a household name doing just that. however, hines thinks hes a filmmaker, so hes content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning.br br secondly, hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie, but he has no idea how to use them. now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy. i believe good science fiction cinema doesnt need dazzling technical effects. some really potent scifis have flourished on virtually none at all. but the war of the worlds as film requires a certain baseline effort. wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled. the effects dont need to be complex they can even be crude e.g. fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george palbyron haskins 1953 version, but they must be handled well. unfortunately hines effects are both crude and incompetent tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice and on ad nauseum. crude technique is forgivable. so you have a cg fire effect thats less than convincing? fine, we can work around that. just dont use it too often and only show glimpses of it. that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum? throw it away. its not necessary. you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string? if you must use it, go ahead, but please dont show it twice! but no, hines wont listen. we get the worst looking stuff used again and again. gotta get those 180 minutes somehow, boy.br br next we have acting, or more precisely too much acting. whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out. evidently hines thinks hes getting a bargain more fleeing in terror over there! you, quaking behind that tree, lets have a real conniption fit this take. you call that writhing in agony? nonsense, my grandmother can writhe better nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink. they arent even good amateurs. but this neednt prove fatal. many a good movie has been made with rancid acting. thats what directors are for. and editors. which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory? if americas butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef. in spite of the near threehour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie not sequences, but single frames, creating a herkyjerky effect thats nauseating to watch. maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890s. if he was i can say he doesnt know how to do it.",0,5552,981

"ll cool j performed much better in this movie that i expected! he did a fabulous job acting as a renegade cop within a renegade department. from the very beginning, he does a great job of building viewer empathy for his character and the predicament hes in. he acts as a sort of gentle giant a person whose rough exterior can scare anybody, yet whose heart is clearly in the right place from the very start and he does an amazing job. he was quite clearly the best character in the movie.br br this was certainly a performance that will not win morgan freeman any awards. after starring in powerhouse films like the shawshank redemption this film was certainly a step down. his role in edison simply did not allow him to show his true talents as an actor and in terms of the conglomeration of characters placed him sadly on a back burner. there are so many ways his character moses ashford could have taken a more pivotal role. that he didnt was disappointing and a true letdown. i was hoping to see more from him in this film.br br timberlake ought to have stayed in the music industry. his portrayal of a young journalist was poorly acted and unpersuasive. this movie is a typical action movie that at least initially bears some resemblance to corrupt police affairs la has experienced in the past. being an action movie, it has its share of shootemup scenes, blood, and guts. these scenes are typically unrealistic and painfully predictable. watching the beginning of the movie there is very little suspense as to what will happen at the end think of what you would typically expect in a goodcopsbadcops conflict and it bears little resemblance to a real police shootout.br br what irked me most was the way timberlakes character behaved during shootout scenes. he starts out having guns and not using them. then when he finally gets around to using one he fires it as if hes been firing a gun his whole life. then he runs out of bullets and doesnt have a gun and 30 seconds later, without moving or anything suddenly has 2 more fully loaded guns and extra ammo?! little plot errors like this really ruined the movie for me.br br if what you are looking for is a blatantly fictional plot in a fantasy world where everything turns out okay, then youll probably love this movie. personally, it doesnt matter to me what kind of movie it is as long as it is realistic. make me believe that the story is true. this story was so obviously fictional in so many aspects that i came away feeling unsatisfied.",0,2502,451

"the london underground has something inherently creepy about it, with its long winding tunnels, the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground, and of course the rats roaming the tracks.it a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often. it was used in the seventies horror deathline aka raw meat, featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel, and the celebrated chase sequence in american werewolf in london. so i was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent uk production creep.br br i thought the film started off well, with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving, followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of london. however, creep went downhill from here, and i found myself wishing that id switched it off after this opening scene, leaving me with a favourable impression of the film. all the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable, even potente herself, and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness. he also made the mistake of showing the monster in full lighting, where he ceases to become remotely scary, and reveals his name to be craig. how can you have a monster called craig? it turns into an x filestype thing, and reminds one of the episode tombs. in fact, i was wishing mulder and scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.br br as for the infamous sexualised violence, it is very graphic, disturbing and totally unnecessary. it seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value. the trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror, which is a mistake as its only halfway through the film.br br so there you go. the only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from ken campbell, one of my favourite occasional actors. you dont see him very often, but when hes on screen he acts everyone else into a corner. casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius, unfortunately the only one evident in the film.",0,2214,393

"i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema. so after watching the trailer for water lilies, i expected to like this film because i thought id stumbled on something unique a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love sort of a female version of beautiful thing. br br the main characters are young french women 15 years old. marie is slender, reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful and anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature. the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie, if not at the surface, then just below it. br br water lilies, however, is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at crosspurposes and in at least two instances joyless, mechanical sex. it also proves that screenwriters and filmmakers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.br br in the extra features on the lord of the flies dvd, director peter brook says, french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex, meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism. part of the downfall of this film is filmmaker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.br br where is the joy? i asked myself while watching this film. yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, lifeaffirming way. these positive aspects are missing from this movie there is no balance.br br organically, this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film. first, what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema, as evidenced by films like the slingshot the rascals the devil, probably the little thief murmur of the heart friends beau pere and europa, europa but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion see, audience, i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude. either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity wouldve been an honest way to go.br br there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing. what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie it is filmmaker sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.br br perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie shes about to request something that is not normal. marie understandably asks, who cares about being normal? then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie, because florianes request is a phony, derivative and substitute question not the authentic, heartfelt question the movie, maries character and the viewers whove invested their time deserve. br br here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewers nerves 1 since when do the french of all people take baths wearing bathing suits, and with a turtle to boot? 2 what teen of any nationality would chomp down on an apple core thats been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloveds mouth?br br the three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, may become excellent actors. louise blachere anne is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. adele haenel floriane could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both. pauline acquart marie possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable. in the future, she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.br br all in all, water lilies was very disappointing. will an honest filmmaker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! no not necessarily for the sake of this middleaged guy but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with. and yes, to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema.",0,4194,705

"even thought im not the biggest of cher fans, this movie was her crowning achievement. granted, there were long term sideeffects and risks of brain damage, memory loss and intellectual impairment, upon the screening such a film. a 1989 survey of moonstruck fans by the uk advocacy network revealed that onethird of 300 moonstruck fans surveyed believed moonstruck had damaged them and an astounding 80 claimed it had irreparably destroyed their minds.br br cher plays someone very uncher in this movie, a dowdy young widow named loretta living in new york with her extended family. theyre antiamerican, proitalian and always at each other in someway. she has been going out with johnny camarary for a while, a nice mammas boy man, and he asks her to marry him. she says yes. i loved her moms questions do you love him loretta?, no., good. if you love him hell drive you crazy because they know they can. but you like him then?, oh yeah, hes a sweet man ma. when johnny goes off to sicily to care for his dying mother, he asks that loretta make contact with his brother who hes been estranged from for years.br br this victory for human rights carries even greater significance, as sicily was the birthplace of electroshock treatment. in 1938, italian psychiatrist ugo cerletti, saw slaughterhouse workers using electric shock devices to cause epileptic fits in pigs, easing the job of slitting their throats. cerletti was inspired, and began experimenting with electroshock on humans, developing the first electroshock machine. broken bones and fractured vertebrae that resulted from the convulsions appeared to be of little concern.br br this was,in so many ways, an antiamerican movie. its about love, to be sure, but its also about infidelity, secrets, lonely people, and strange behavior brought on by american policies. the characters, from the frumpy bobo at the favorite restaurant, the aunt and uncle, her parents and their problems, the ancient grandfather and his dogs are all well developed and intrinsic characters. its somewhat of a chick flick, as its how loretta stops being a dowdy stuffed shirt and awakens the flower of the inner vamp. its a cinderella story in many ways, and that is every little girls dream to emerge from the ugly duckling into a beautiful swan...br br assuming free and fully informed consent, it is well to reaffirm the individuals right to pursue happiness through brain damage if he or she so chooses. but we might ask ourselves whether we, as fans of cinema, though in no way sworn to any hippocratic oath, should be offering it.",0,2572,433

"having seen three other versions of the same film, i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to scotts rather dull and leaden performance. his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better. when scrooge was at his meanest, you dont get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version. even the musical version and frankly the muppets take on this are better executed. very disappointing.",0,658,113

he wouldnt, period. then we also have the bartender2nd rape dude. actually i dont think you would need him. at least not for the 2nd rape, but more about that later on.br br lets reprise the story. rosarios character is sexually insecure, might even have lesbian tendencies see her scene with a female friend. this wasnt intentional, as rosario states herself, but there is sexual tension between them. rosarios character meets a guy, who is a sexual predator, in all the bad senses. but he makes an impression on her.br br rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before. i beg to differ. because she acts, as if it is her first boyfriend, which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother. talking about her mother, heres another problem. after the first rape takes place, rosarios character doesnt tell anyone what happened. seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one, nothing of that gets explored after that. if rosarios character wouldnt call her mother anymore or would behave strangely, the mother would be worried like crazy. there was so much potential here. also her female friend we see her at the party, its obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone.br br the first rape is almost unbearable to watch. but feels like a pinch, when you compare it to the ending rape, which feels like youre getting hit with a sledge hammer! after rape no. 1 we get too stretched out scenes. threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian, as one guy states who tried to hit on her ..., but left in the open. no real social contact is established, if you leave the bartender guy out, who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene. its apparent that he isnt a nice guy and his character gets fleshed out a bit. but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again, his being in the movie seems pointless. we get the point that rosarios character isnt the same anymore, that she went bad and is able to hurt people. too many scenes show exactly that, her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff. back to rapist 1 who cheats on a test, gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again really?. as absurd as that sounds, the guy meets up with her, not without us having seen him beforehand, with another girl very likely that he raped her too, although we never see anything of that, fortunately and his football career. well career is a stretch and he is bullied. this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works, but then again is too clich to stay with you. so rapist 1 submits to rosarios character ... why exactly? because he promised her, it was her day? again, really? a guy like that never loses control, especially with a woman he raped before ... i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is. the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something, but letting him submit like that, just feels wrong. another possibility would have a drug in his drink.br br so rapist 1 undresses and gets blindfolded and lets rosarios character tie him on a bed .... seriously, thats just crazy! but what comes next, is even crazier. first she talks to him, then she shuts him up and forces an object into him. this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one. this isnt about what this guy deserves or not, its just intense. and of course that was what they were aiming for. now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes ... rapist 1. if this really should work as a revenge movie, it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the revenge. having a henchman doing the job, takes away everything that was built up.br br this isnt supposed to be entertainingenjoyable, its a hard watch it is arthouse. but the 10 minute i didnt count rape scene at the end, just smashes everything. rosarios character is more or less, only watching what happens. which brings me to the biggest disappointment.br br irreversible comparison irreversible had the rape scene, but the movie went on even if it was back into time. rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this. first, that comes a bit too late, that should see her say that after the initial rape. and secondly and most importantly, this is where the arthouse movie shouldve come in. it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope, with what she had done. but then again, she didnt actually physically do that much see above ... a broken character that the movie cuts off ...br br good intentions talia and rosario had worked before, but failing to convey most of the things, they set out to do even if you can see what they meant, it has to be convincing, otherwise it doesnt work ... not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are ...",0,5465,992

"i saw descent last night at the stockholm film festival and it was one huge disappointment. disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing rosario dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan sounds pervy, im not! of raperevenge flicks of the 70s, i was needless to say very curious to check this movie out. my conclusion lets stick to the classics! yes, the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat, the actors unconvincing. even dawson is empty. some would say that its a right depiction of the college world in the us, that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial. just like the scene where dawson gets raped it seriously lacks intensity! i wasnt expecting anything irreversiblestyle but still, arent we suppose to feel compassion for her? i didnt. not for a minute, she was so lame all the way and i read that the photography was impressive. well, it is good indeed but nothing groundbreaking either. i must admit that the screening at the festival wasnt so good so maybe i missed out something here but at the end of the movie, i couldnt help thinking i feel like watching argentos inferno again. lol. more seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but i had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the americancanadian border in lynchs twin peaks fire walk with me... the crude red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general lasciviousdecadent atmosphere... no, i just couldnt get into this movie. too bad.",0,1650,287

"within the realm of science fiction, two particular themes consistently elicit interest, were initially explored in the literature of a precinematic era, and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike, with varying degrees of success. the first theme, that of time travel, has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film, as well as the written word, most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h.g. wells classic, the time machine. the second theme, which also manages to hold audiences in thrall, is that of invisibility, which sparks the imagination with its seemingly endless and myriad possibilities. and this theme, too, has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h.g. wells classic, the invisible man, the realization of which, here, is hollow man, directed by paul verhoeven, and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue.br br sebastian caine bacon and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u.s. government, exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility, which they have, at last, achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method. they have, in fact, progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original visual state of being. its a problem, however, that caine, after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab, has solved or so he thinks. and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful, he decides to present the results to the board of directors, in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project.br br at the last minute, though, caine demurs, fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level the testing of a human subject. and he takes it upon himself to become that subject, securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that theyve been given approval by the board to do so. but something goes wrong, and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before its too late, it all begins to take a toll on caines mind. and suddenly, his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential, as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that. now theres a very real chance that he may lose everything including himself.br br verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting, even thought provoking film he establishes a good pace and uses the fx at his disposal to great effect, though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development. anyone familiar with the invisible man, or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story, will know early on that caine is not destined for happier times. still, verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience. but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax, and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful, opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless bloodandgore fest that betrays his audience and everything hes worked for earlier in the film. rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caines suffering, and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to its inevitable conclusion, verhoeven takes the low road, and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level, any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind, along with anything that would have made this a memorable film. and its a shame, because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre, and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower.br br kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable, if only on the surface, which seemingly serves verhoevens purposes perfectly. theres little depth to bacons portrayal, but it has more to do with his directors agenda than his own acting abilities. verhoeven simply does not allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story, and toward that end, it works. the film would have been better served, however, had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part, something that would have drawn them in a bit, rather than leaving them at the gate, as it were, as mere observers of an fx laden extravaganza.br br elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay, caines willing accomplice in the illfated experiment, but its basically a thankless part that offers little challenge, especially to an actor of shues caliber. the same can be said of kim dickens so magnificent in the 2001 film, things behind the sun. her character, sarah kennedy, does little more than support the action and fx. both actors are capable of so much more, and deserve better than what they are given to work with here.br br the supporting cast includes josh brolin matthew, greg grunberg carter, joey slotnick frank, mary randle janice and william devane dr. kramer. entertaining to a point, and even successful on a certain low level, hollow man is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been. like an annual fireworks display, it will give you some momentary thrills, but after awhile itll begin to blend in with all the others youve seen, without anything special to set it apart. and its too bad, because given the talent and abilities of those involved here, it could have been so much more. i rate this one 410.br br br br br br",0,5916,1011

"here was no effort put into valentine to prevent it from being just another teenage slasher film, a subgenre of horror films of which we have seen entirely too many over the last decade or so. ive heard a lot of people complaining that the film rips off several previous horror movies, including everything from halloween to prom night to carrie, and as much as i hate to be redundant, the rip off is so blatant that it is impossible not to say anything. the punch bowl over poor jeremys head early in the film is so obviously taken from carrie that they may as well have just said it right in the movie hey everyone, this is the director, and the following is my carrieripoff scene. enjoy!. but thats just a suggestion.br br spoilers the film is structured piece by piece exactly the same way that every other goofy teen thriller is structured. we get to know some girl briefly at the beginning, she gets killed, people wonder in the old ohbutthatstuffonlyhappenstootherpeople tone, and then they start to get killed. the problem here is that the director and the writers clearly and honestly want to keep the film mysterious and suspenseful, but they have no idea how to do it. take jason, for example. here is this hopelessly arrogant guy who is so full of himself and bad with women that he divides the check on a date according to what each person had, and as one of the first characters seen in the film after the brief history lesson about how bad poor jeremy was treated, he is assumed to carry some significance. besides that, and more importantly, he has the same initials as the little boy that all the girls terrorized in sixth grade, and the same initials that are signed at the bottom of all of those vicious valentines day cards. br br it is not uncommon for the audience to be deliberately and sometimes successfully misled by the behavior of one or more characters that appear to be prime suspects, and jason is a perfect example of the effort, but not such a good example of a successful effort. sure, i thought for a while that he might very well be the killer, but thats not the point. we know from early on that he is terrible with women, which links him to the little boy at the beginning of the film, but then in the middle of the film, he appears at a party, smiles flirtatiously at two of the main girls, and then gives them a hateful look and walks away, disappearing from the party and from the movie with no explanation. we already know he is a cardboard character, but his role in the film was so poorly thought out that they just took him out altogether when they were done with him.br br on the positive side, the killers true identity was, in fact, made difficult to predict in at least one subtle way which was also, unfortunately, yet another ripoff. early in the film, when shelley stabs the killer in the leg with his own scalpel, he makes no sound, suggesting that the killer might be a female staying silent to prevent revealing herself as a female, rather than a male as everyone suspects. but then for the rest of the film, we just have this stolid, relentless, unstoppable killer with the emotionless mask and that gigantic butcher knife. director jamie blanks who, with all due respect, looks like he had some trouble with the girls himself in the sixth grade mentions being influenced by halloween. this is, of course, completely unnecessary, because its so obvious from how badly he plagiarizes the film. the only difference between the killer in valentine and michael meyers is that michaels mask was so much more effective and he didnt have a problem with nosebleeds. this stuff is shameless. br br at the end, there is a brief attempt to mislead us one more time as to who the killer is complete with slow and drawn out andthekilleris mask removal, but then we see adams nose start to bleed as he holds kate, his often reluctant girlfriend, and we know that hes been the killer all along. nothing in the film hinted that he might be the killer until the final act, and these unexplained nosebleeds were not exactly the cleverest way to identify the true killer at the end of the film. valentine is not scary i watched it in an empty house by myself after midnight, and i have been afraid of the dark for as long as i can remember, and even i wasnt scared, and the characters might be possible to care about if it werent so obvious that they were just going to die. i remember being impressed by the theatrical previews although the film was in and out of the theaters faster than battlefield earth, but the end result is the same old thing.",0,4587,836

"...that jamie foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful, oscarwinning performance. one of the reasons why i was so impressed with foxxs performance in ray was because from watching his hammy, obnoxious acting in movies like bait and booty call, i would never imagine he would ever hold the oscar. if people told me five years ago that jamie foxx was one day going to win an oscar, i would laugh right in their faces. who knows? maybe hes better off sticking to drama, because if you watch bait, its clearly evident that comedy is not his forte. i swear, jamie mugs so much in this movie that im surprised his face didnt fall off. and why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets? anyone familiar with comedians like bob newhart and steven wright knows that doing comedy doesnt require being loud and obnoxious. if a joke is funny, its funny. if its not funny, then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier. the problem i have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character. in real life, normal people dont always have witty comebacks and quips. like albert brooks said in an interview discussing his character in taxi driver, its important to be funny as your character, rather than be funny as a comedian. a prime example of jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken, and he starts posing for the photographs like a model. if a regular person were being thrown in jail, would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken? and wouldnt the police try to scold him if he was? there are many scenes like that throughout the film. another awful sequence is one where jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain, and he starts doing a phony caribbean accent. not funny! not to mention jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke. giving a comedic performance requires patience, whereas he goes straight to the punchline, whether its the right time for it or not. im not even a big mike epps fan, but even his performance is good in comparison to jamies. as a matter of fact, this is the first time i felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen. epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy, but at least he chooses a more lowkey approach. one of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is david morse, a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains. he seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality. however, fellow green mile star doug hutchison is disgustingly overthetop as the villain. a big surprise, considering he gave a superb performance in the green mile, also playing a heavy. antoine fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like the replacement killers and training day. even in bait, he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence. his only problem seemed to be in disciplining jamie foxx, who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another. unless youre a diehard fan of foxx, please dont take the bait.",0,3119,563

"this is an anthology horror film. its made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h.p. lovecraft, but is most famous for the original story psycho. the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didnt think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all. it would have been better to do it as a comedy like comedy of terrors. only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way, and its probably the best of them the one with ingrid pitt. ive seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis tales from the crypt. the anthology style works well for the producers, because it means that they can hire a bunch of big name actors, employ them for only one week of shooting or so, and then bring in the next big name. so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee. but thats very unfortunate for the audience, because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing, christopher lee, and ingrid pitt actually acting together. instead theyre stuck in these vignettes by themselves. so lets take them one at a time, briefly.br br the first story has denholm elliot, who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character. unfortunately the actor who plays dominic, the source of the horror, tom adams, just looks silly which ruins any possible horror. theres some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though, like the scene where dominic kills elliots psychiatrist. its the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching, so the whole audience is supposed to shout out look out behind you! the second story is the one with peter cushing. god i love that man so much. too bad so many of his films, like this one, pretty much stink. in the story hes supposed to be pining away for a longlost love, and he sees her likeness in a wax museum. its a completely predictable story that goes nowhere.br br then you have the bit with christopher lee, where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch. again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs. but instead were supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil. the actress, chloe franks, was pretty good in that type of bad seed role though.br br the last story is kind of amusing... ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire. thats about all the story has to offer. i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitts english is, i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films ive seen her in.br br not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists.",0,2951,554

"as a kid i did think the weapon the murderer wielded was cool, however i was a kid and so i was a bit dumb. even as a dumb kid though the movies plot was stupid and a bit boring when the killer was not using his light knife to kill people. what amazes me is that the movie has a really solid cast in it. what script did they read when agreeing to be in this movie as it is most assuredly boring and only a means to show off a light saber on a very small scale. the plot at times is incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. the whole film seems to rotate around aliens and the one weapon. the plot has two kids and some dude having an alien encounter, flash years later and there seems to be a return as it were in the mix. dead animals and such to be explored and for some reason the one dude gets the weapon of the aliens and proceeds to use it to go on a very light killing spree. seriously, you just have to wonder why this movie was made, if you are going to have a killer have some good death scenes, if you are going to have alien encounters show more than a weird light vortex thing, and if you are going to have light sabers then call yourself star wars.",0,1170,238
"warning this review contains spoilers. do not read if you dont want some points revealed to you before you watch the film.br br with a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. did they see the script and say, hey, close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one cant fail. unfortunately, it does. did they even think to check on the directors credentials? i mean, would you do a movie with the director of a movie called satans cheerleaders? greydon clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous final justice, made this. it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer final justice and completely miss out on the return.br br the film is set in a small town in new mexico. a little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. it looked like clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults dont believe the children. elsewhere, we see vincent schiavelli, whom i find to be a terrific actor watch his scenes in ghost for proof, as they are outstanding, who is playing a prospector, or as i called him, the miner 1949er. he steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. twentyfive years go by, and the girl has grown up to be cybill shepherd, who works with her father, raymond burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. or something like that. shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town, and she travels there to research it. once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy janmichael vincent comes to her rescue. from this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after vincent wards off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twentyfive years earlier. while this boring mess is happening, vincent schiavelli, with his killer dog at his side, is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item. you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trickortreaters at halloween, the kind that you shake to make them glow? schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people. its the secondworst effect in the movie. every time schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick, the scenes atmosphere suddenly turns dark, like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement. it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is.br br and what does all this lead up to? its hard to tell when the final, confusing scene arrives. see, burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of calling card, but none of it makes sense. why do shepherd and vincent age and schiavelli does not? schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead, but even that doesnt make much sense when you really think about it. i mean, why doesnt he kill janmichael vincent? after all, he had twentyfive years to do it. and the aliens wont need him if shepherd is dead anyhow, so why try to kill her? speaking of the aliens, it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent. what is their goal? why do they wait so long to intervene? how could they be so sure shepherd would come back? not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made the return any more pleasant. you would still have bad lines, really bad acting, particularly by shepherd, cheesy effects, and poor direction. luckily, the stars escaped from this movie. cybill shepherd soon went on to star in moonlighting with bruce willis. janmichael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of bmovies, often in overthetop parts. raymond burr made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death. vincent schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films. martin landau, who played a kooky law enforcement officer, quickly made the terrific alone in the dark and the awful the being before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently. you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to the return. zantaras score 2 out of 10.",0,4644,837

"i jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it. but wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. the dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.br br what a disappointment. chamberlains nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something i found myself mirroring as the film wore on. what could have been eerie aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into ones head. the ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the aboriginal peoples believe redhaired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension the dream time.br br spoiler in the final scene, it wasnt clear to me what the director was trying to tell. is there a big wave? so what? how big? a tsunami? yeah, okay. thats devastating but not apocalyptic. is it the end of the world? from a wave? the last wave? thatd have to be a pretty darn big wave. why? was the world that bad a place? it didnt seem so awful in this movie. actually i didnt think the wave came off, since the shadow left burtons face that had been cast by the wave. was it only burtons apocalypse? heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. it wasnt of any interest if it was only him.br br the most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of weirs potential, was in charlies apartment where burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring burtons wife. charlie keeps asking him who are you? and it becomes truly disturbing after a while. unfortunately, the movie never followed suit.",0,1880,331

"wow, the plot for this film is all over the place! there is so much plot and so many things that happen that it practically made my head spin!! and, as a result, none of it seemed particularly believable.br br the movie starts with kay francis as a housewife living in a small town. shes had some experience with local theater and has ambitions of going to broadway. when a bigtime actor arrives in town, she pursues him in hopes that he can give her a career boost. but, her husband is worried about shenanigansas this actor is a cad. so, the hubby bursts in on them and hits the actorand the actor dies! as a result, hes convicted of first degree murder!!! not manslaughter, but murder 1! now, pregnant and in need of funds, kay goes to new york. but broadway jobs arent to be found, so shes forced to take any jobeven burlesque. unable to adequately care for her young daughter, she gives it to another woman to raise. however, eventually she does find a job in a real broadway play and everything looks rosy. but, the jealous diva starring in the play hates her for some inexplicable reason and forces her to be thrown off the play. despondent, she makes her way to england and becomes a real star. years later, she returns to new york to get her kidbut the child is older and thinks the woman caring for her is her real mother. at the same time, her husbands lawyer now thinks that if he gets 10,000 he can get the man out of prison. as another reviewer wrote, is this to bribe people?! how can 10,000 get him out otherwisemaybe it will buy a helicopter so they can fly into the prison yard and scoop him up!! wowthis is enough for 2 or 3 films! and, all this occurs by the 45 minute mark!!! believe it or not, theres quite a bit more to it. if you really care, see it yourself to find out how it all unfolds.br br this is sort of like kitchen sink writingthrowing in practically everything and hoping, somehow, it will all work. unfortunately, the film turns out to be hopelessly unbelievable and mushy despite ms. francis best efforts. its the sort of film no one could really have saved thanks to a 2ndrate plot. its almost as if someone just took a few dozen plot elements, threw them into a box and then began randomly picking them in order to make a movie!! overall, unless you are a diehard kay francis fan or love anything hollywood made in the 1930s, this one is one you can easily skip. not terrible but certainly not good.br br by the way, the child who plays francis daughter upon her return to new york sybil jason really was terrible. i think she was supposed to be...i think.",0,2595,485

"i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original have not seen, and doubt i will. it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performancecharacter from its supposed male lead jimmy fallon.br br fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. hes supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot. not fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone its hard to have a one person romance tells fallon that its over, too much has happened, and shes moving on. and rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for fallon, you are actively cheering her on finally she does what she should have done months ago. but of course the plot mechanics wont allow that to be the end of it an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess, and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.",0,1900,356

"contains spoilers!!!br br timon and pumbaa are watching the lion king. timon decides to go back before the beginning, to when the story really began. so they go back. way back. back even before simba was born. back to timons old home which was miles away from pride rock. a clan of meerkats burrowed underground to hide from hyenas. the worst digger in the clan was a pompous, selfcentered meerkat named timon. his mother took pity on him but uncle max just shook his head. mother suggested putting timon on sentry duty timon had dreams of a bigger and better place out there somewhere. just then, hyenas shenzi, bonzai and ed arrived and nearly killed poor uncle max. that did it. the other meerkats just wanted timon to go away while timon took it upon himself to leave. so he kissed his mom goodbye and started off. he didnt get very far before he started getting homesick. just then he met rafiki, who taught him to look beyond what he sees. timon had no clue what that meant so he continued on and met a warthog named pumbaa, who was all alone due to a flatulence problem. timon and pumbaa join up then, but timon declared them acquaintances, rather than friends.br br they soon arrive at pride rock where all the zebras, antelopes, wildebeests, rhinoceroses, giraffes, elephants and many other plain animals had gathered. what was going on? timon didnt care. they pressed on. timon then saw rafiki atop pride rock lifting into the air something he couldnt see. just then all the animals took a bow. was this to honor the birth of the new king? no, pumbaa had passed gas and the animals were bowing to cover their noses timon and pumbaa try an assortment of new homes, but each are discomforting due to incessant singing or hyenas or a large stampede of wildebeests! pumbaa and timon suddenly find themselves heading down stream. when they reach land, timon decides to give up. but then they gaze around at their newfound paradise. it was beautiful trees and water falls as far as the eye could see. timon named the place after a strange phrase he learned from rafiki hakuna matata. timon and pumbaa go out bowling for buzzards one afternoon when they suddenly run into simba. they take him under their wing and become father figures. they teach him the arts of bug eating and belching contests. pretty soon, a teenage simba takes on timon in a snail slurping contest. simba won, leaving timon deathly ill.br br then one day, simbas childhood friend nala arrived. timon and pumbaa just knew shed break up the friendship. suddenly, simba runs away. nala and pumbaa race after him, but not timon. he chose to stay at hakuna matata by himself, until rafiki talked some sense into him, so he joins his friends at pride rock. timons mother and uncle max arrive then. while simba battles scar, mother and max dig a large hole to trap hyenas shenzi, bonzai and ed in. it worked. scar is soon flung down the same hole where he is devoured by the hyenas. then all is well. mother, uncle max and the rest of the meerkats go live with timon and pumbaa in the paradise that is hakuna matata. back to the present, timon and pumbaa finish the movie when suddenly mother, uncle max, simba and rafiki want to watch it again. so do mickey mouse, donald duck, goofy, snow white, the seven dwarfs, dumbo, peter pan, the lost boys, mad hatter, march hare, genie, aladdin, and jasmine.br br well, i must say that the lion king 1 12 wasnt as good as i had hoped. it was too ridiculous and silly. the original lion king was a masterpiece. it had a serious story with light comedy thrown in. this one was just silly and made a mockery of it. i swear, sometimes timon and pumbaa are just way too overplayed. theyre overplayed to the point of no longer being funny, just annoying. the original voice cast is back nathan lane as timon, ernie sabella as pumbaa, matthew broddrick as adult simba, whoopi goldberg as shenzi, cheech marin as bonzai, jim cummings as ed, robert guillame as rafiki. new to the cast are julie kavner of tvs too long running series the simpsons as timons mom and jerry stiller as uncle max. so anyway, this movie isnt the lion king iii, and it isnt ii because there already is a ii. it takes place right after part i and part ii is a ways away. hence, its 1 12. in conclusion, i dont recommend this to die hard lion king fans because its far too ridiculous and frivilous. however the kids will love it so i recommend it to them. i hope this will also be the last lion king movie. two is enough. the lion king 1 12. what weve come to expect from disney sequel makers.br br",0,4574,832
"its not like i have overwhelmingly fond memories of verhoevens original pantsdown shocker it always struck me as a glossy, wellmade airportnovelofamovie. thrilling, sexy trash, but trash nonetheless. it was also a film that tapped into a certain sexual zeitgeist. after a decade of antisex aidsinduced hysteria, a film about a wildlysexual hotbod who thrillkills to heighten her sexual pleasure was pretty enticing stuff. basic instinct 2 was always going to struggle to provide the same social relevance and immediacy, so the fact that its desperate attempts at raunchiness are so lame can sortof be overlooked. all it really had to provide was that thin veneer of titillation and a mildly engaging story and all would have been watchable. that it resoundingly fails on so many levels, and in such a way to be a career nadir for everyone involved, is really quite extraordinary to watch. lets state the obvious for starters sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell. what was so photogenic thru verhoevens lens looks like mutton dressed as lamb in the hands of gunforhire michael catonjones, whos flat, drab colours and static camera render her undeniable beauty totally moot. i like sharon stone a lot, but if the first film launched her career, bi2 could kill it. she has no chemistry with stuffedshirt david morrissey their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch. his doughfaced mammas boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering, orangeskin machismo of michael douglas. supporting turns by david thewlis and charlotte rampling waste these fine actors on talky exposition scenes and clichheavy posturing. and what of the muchtouted sexual shenanigans? poorlylit, fleetinglyglimpsed, as utterly mainstream as an episode of desperate housewives the european sensibilities that verhoeven brought to the sexual content of the first film are sorely missed. dont watch this film for carnal thrills there are none and what there is is tragic. the film is, as a whole, convoluted to the point of utter confusion, boring and laughable. the last 40 minutes in particular, where you come to the realisation that the film is, in fact, not going to go anywhere of interest at all, are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure. as a failed sequel, basic instinct 2 will come to occupy similar cinematic ground as exorcist 2 the heretic, beyond the poseidon adventure and xxx2. as a vanity project, it rivals battlefield earth in its misconception. as a multimillion dollar piece of hollywood filmmaking, its a travesty that will be hard to top as the years worst.",0,2607,428

"what an insult to olivia dabo who plays the films heroine, robin, to have keanu reeves appear so large on the box art of the film and at least on recent reissues, to have only reeves appear on the box, considering that she was the star. i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this longforgotten after school special, but at least give the woman some credit. br br despite that, this has to be one of the worst teen sportsthemed films that i have ever seen, and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie clich from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance. and, in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of flashdance with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to michael sembellos notable maniac which was made famous by flashdance, or was it the other way around?. it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet, even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny danceoffs between the heroine and her antagonists, the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team. we saw this in trashin a vert ramp joust and rad bmx dancing at the prom, although it wasnt much for competition, but rather for fun for example. in fact, this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness, such as the somewhat homoerotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the team.br br nonetheless, the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background. to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible, she lives with her ailing mother, her obnoxious sister, and her careless and slightly abusive stepfather. needless to say, homelife is not so appealing. add to the mix, a talent for gymnastics, but several obstacles to joining the team including the nuisance of her arrogant, snobby teammates, and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well. and, of course, we cant forget that shes got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates, nor that she doesnt have a steady boyfriend although keanu as tommy later enters the picture. could this kid be any more pathetic? and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long, redundant, and clichd quest to prove her worth to everyone.br br but, even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film, are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog. i like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the danceoff to scold the teammates. it makes episodes of amazing stories look like shakespeare.br br i imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor. for that you might be satisfied, but it is also an incredibly forced drama. so, caveat emptour.",0,2976,527

"in director sooraj barjatyas vivah,20something delhi boy shahid kapur finds himself smitten by the demure, smalltown girl his father has selected for him to marry. drawn to her innocence and simplicity, shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after hes met her at her home in madhupur, and the young lady in question amrita rao seems equally floored by her charming suitor. the marriage is fixed for six months later, and the couple find themselves in the first throes of young, budding love, their geographical distance notwithstanding. but amrita, whos been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents death, is struck by a horrible calamity just hours before the marriage. and then, its up to shahid to play the honourable lover and to embrace her unconditionally.much in the same vein as hum aapke hain koun and hum saath saath hain, barjatyas new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise. but sadly, the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated, even more farfetched than those regressive ekta kapoor soaps. and the problem is clear you just cant relate to such squeakyclean characters who dont have one bad bone in their bodies. there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films, and timing is one such important factor. twentyfive years ago, perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch, but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time warp. perhaps the films only saving grace is the fact that it oozes sincerity from start to finish, you can make out right away that the filmmakers intention is not to deceive. judging both by barjatyas previous films and by closely examining this new one you can safely declare that barjatya believes in a perfect world, he believes in his goodasgold characters, he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest bumps.but alas, hes unable to translate his vision to the screen. its difficult to overlook how onedimensional his protagonists are shahid and amrita, both virtuous and virginal i mean, think about it, the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film. barjatya may think hes returning to his maine pyar kiya roots with vivah, but truth is that the reason we embraced salman and bhagyashree in that film, or even salman and madhuri in hum aapke hain koun is because they had such fantastic chemistry. because although they were created out of the same mould as shahid and amrita in vivah, those pairs had mischief and masti. shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring.for a film that relies so heavily on music to narrate its story, the filmmaker chooses a string of 70sstyle tunes that only further slacken the films deadening pace. but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesnt work for me, its because im not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit barjatyas story. to some perhaps, vivah will give hope, that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere. but im a little cynical i guess. so, give me the coquettish madhuri of hum aapke hain kaun, give me the bratty salman of maine pyar kiya, ill even take that mischievous karisma kapoor of hum saath saath hain. but save me from these dullards. you know, some marriages arent made in heaven. this ones vivah!",0,3375,591

i dunno. the soldiers, presumably because theyre military, all seem to just rather unconvincingly explode, like the soldier on crutches and his unfortunate comrades carrying the stretcher just beyond him. wow! i loved it! but the soldiers all looked like they were either fascist troops from the spanish civil war, or boer commandos which would be more or less correct for the period. perhaps that was some bit of shrewd subtlety on the part of that wicked genius hines?. oddly enough, the character of the curate looks exactly like hes drawn in the original illustrations by warwick goble, and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting. oh, yeah. musnt forget the thunder child. in the book, the warship is described as an ironclad torpedoram. it was meant to ram enemy ships. yet, its bow was crumpled after ramming the tinkertoy constructed martian war machines, with a tiny jagged hole in the forepeak, and she sank. an ironclad warship like thunderchild couldve rammed the titanic and survived, but i guess the royal navy was bound by the same lowestbidder constraints as our own military. the costumes are all wrong, especially the british army and police uniforms, cobbled together mostly from usmc alphas. and timbo, in an obvious homage to western films of yore, has obviously set his movie in wild western england, because all his riders are using western saddles. the accents being used by just about everyone appear to be a mixture of some kind of scottish regional accent used by clan macabre, and magically delicious irish accents from county malarky. on the credit side, and contrary to what one reviewer wrote, the only genuine, authentic feature of this thing is the artillery. the guns are not from the civil war, but appear to my eye and research as bonafide british nine or 12 pounder rifled breach loaders, perfectly authentic to the period. so was the ammunition shown being used. but the artilleryman, who is a driver in the horse artillery, was not shown correctly driving his limber. you dont sit on the frigging limber box and drive a gun team, you ride the nearside wheel horses. the opening, using what i believe is authentic period film footage, is okay, and the scores not bad. however, to the best of my knowledge weybridge has never had an underground, and it certainly didnt in 1898.br br but growing up reading this novel, i am very disappointed. even more disappointed then i was at spielbergs zillion dollar, special effects laden version. maybe his version would have profited by swapping anthony piana for tom cruise, and vice versa. i have a lot more to say, but ill let it go at this for now i wish somebody would make a good version of war of the worlds thats faithful to the original. timmys vision is fine for a high school film class, or maybe i should say pretentiously stupid for a collegelevel film student, and about as bad, which is about the best i can say for this thing, but thats about it. oh, yeah. just where did the budget go? and what happened to michael caine? id like to hear his comments! i have a sneaking suspicion that timbo orson wood hines breathtaking, boundbreaking cinema masterpiece just might be the risktaking directors ticket to cult stardom, because, i must confess a guilty pleasure at watching this movie, which i didnt pay for anyway but was thoughtfully sent to me by a friend who burned a dvd copy for me, with no malicious intent that ive been able to determine. i must add here that i thought blackmoons dubbed and abridged version was not only a vast improvement, but an absolute, hysterically funny in a good way treat to watch. i find it hard to watch master timbos version after blackmoon. keep it up, tim! make your own version of dune, now. it just awaits the hand of a master like you! and all you headupyourass snobs who hated cloverfield?

"im not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon retellings, but this film truly peeved me off. the original prom night, while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. there are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! the scares were cheap, and foreshadowed terribly. a good example of scare which has been done to clichd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film this film couldnt successfully pull that off, so how could i expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. there needs to be a likable hero or heroine. this film doesnt have one. the person i most identified with was the head detective. his calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. common sense approach to events that occur. if youre running from an axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killers progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path. if you friend disappears, you dont go looking for them alone. and if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. these clichs are tired and well overplayed. in the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.",0,1546,271
"i have this film out of the library right now and i havent finished watching it. it is so bad i am in disbelief. audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although shed pretty much finished with it in robin and marian. this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. its really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide.br br there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies. little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow.br br who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in breakfast at tiffanys twenty years earlier? the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obviousyou sure dont have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cinemusique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you.br br reverting to type means going back up as well as going back down, i guess. in this case, audrey hepburns chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. here she has even lost her talent as a star. if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like annmargret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloidlevel situations.br br hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. after this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called love among thieves. in they all laughed it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50s. even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn. turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. hepburn doesnt take it seriously at all, couldnt be bothered with it even her hair and clothes look tacky. her last really good work was in two for the road, perhaps her most perfect, if possibly not her best in many ways.br br and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening. john ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten, who was truly pretty. otherwise, critic david thomsons oftused phrase losing hisher talent never has made more sense.br br ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then, and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburnwho could ask for anything less? sandra dees last, pitiful film lost, from 2 years later, a lowbudget nothing, had more to it than this. at least ms. dee spoke in her own voice by 1981, audrey hepburns accent just sounded silly shed go on to do the pbs gardens of the world with audrey hepburn and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about what i like most is when flowers go back to nature! as in naturalized daffodils, but in an actual fictional movie, she just sounds ridiculous.br br to think that breakfast at tiffanys was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the worldshe was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in my fair lady, matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in last year at marienbad. and then this! and her final brief role as the angel hap in the spielberg film always was just more of the lady stuffcorny, witless and stifling.br br i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church, a beautiful service which included a boys choir singing the shaker hymn simple gifts. the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburns singing moon river on the fire escape in breakfast at tiffanys, and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation.br br a great lady who was once a fine actress as in the nuns story and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50s and 60s who became a truly bad onethats not all that common. and perhaps it is only a great human being who, in making such things as film performances trivial, nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilesslywhich all of her late film work contained in abundance. most of the talk about hepburns miscasting is about my fair lady. but the one that should have had the original actress in it was wait until dark, which had starred lee remick on broadway. never as celebrated as hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid, although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part. after that, all of her acting went downhill.",0,5002,888

"after hearing the word of mouth of just how bad this film is i took the plunge and bought the dvd. that said everything previously mentioned about this film is true. for a film that claimed to have a budget in the millions it just does not show on the screen at all. the list of problems with the film could drag on forever. chief amongst them is the film is simply too long. it dragged on for a few minutes short of 3 hours. nearly an hour probably could have been cut off the run time had the editor simply removed the overabundance of scenes dealing with nothing more then the main character wandering around aimlessly. br br secondly, as many had pointed out from the trailers, the special effects are anything but special. the tripods looked ok in a few shots here and there but beyond that everything was gradez 1970s or 1980s quality. probably the worst effects of all were the horses, which stiffly tottered back and forth as they moved. the heat ray effects were laughable, as people were reduced to bones that somehow were still able to flail about without any muscles. also pitiful was the thunderchild sequence, in which the thunderchild, described in the book as an ironclad ram, looked nothing of the sort. instead it resembled a world war 1 era destroyer, complete with deck guns which fired but had no visible crew, and torpedo tubes. br br the colors and backgrounds were just as bad as the effects. most laughable of all was a scene early on in which the main character and his wife go for a nighttime stroll and he points out mars to her in the sky. well, the sky is black, but the views of the characters and the landscape around them is broad daylight. there is also a very sharp demarcation between the real landscape, bathed in full sunlight, and the fake black night sky with overly large fuzzy stars. to detract even further, the color of the scenes made no sense. in some they are bathed in orange light. in others green light. in still others its blue light. in some instances the outsides are orange lit but the interiors of houses are green or blue. the framerate and camera is very shaky, giving everything a stuttering look.br br finally, the acting is overall subpar. one man portrays two characters whos sole difference was one lacked a mustache. this led to some confusion at times as to who was who and where they all were. the english accents, even to american ears, are outrageous. br br in summary, this movie could very well make a claim to being the worst film released in recent times. i have not seen gigli or some of the other recent flops but this one, because of its poor quality in every respect, must easily be worse then anything that mainstream hollywood has put out. i would not be surprised if the movie makes it to the bottom 10 or 20 in the imdb rankings. its a pity that mystery science theater is not still around.",0,2869,525

"all i could think of while watching this movie was bgrade slop. many have spoken about its redeeming quality is how this film portrays such a realistic representation of the effects of drugs and an individual and their subsequent spiral into a self perpetuation state of unfortunate events. yet really, the techniques used as many have already mentioned were overused and thus unconvincing and irrelevant to the film as a whole.br br as far as the plot is concerned, it was lacklustre, unimaginative, implausible and convoluted. you can read most other reports on this film and they will say pretty much the same as i would.br br granted some of the actors and actresses are attractive but when confronted with such boring action... looks can only carry a film so far. the action is poor and intermittent a few punches thrown here and there, and a final gunfight towards the end. nothing really to write home about.br br as others have said, bad movies are great to watch for the very reason that they are bad, you revel in that fact. this film, however, is a void. its nothing.br br furthermore, if one is really in need of an educational movie to scare people away from drug use then i would seriously recommend any number of other movies out there that board such issues in a much more effective way. requiem for a dream, trainspotting, fear and loathing in las vegas and candy are just a few examples. though one should also check out some more lighthearted films on the same subject like go overall, both serious and funny and halfbaked.br br on a final note, the one possibly redeeming line in this movie, delivered by vinnie jones was stolen from lock, stock and two smokling barrels. to think that a bit of that great movie has been tainted by loaded is vile.br br overall, i strongly suggest that you save you money and your time by not seeing this movie.",0,1864,331

"well, as goethe once said, there really isnt any point in trying to pass a negative judgement that aspires to be objective on something that has had a great effect. la maman et la putain has surely passed into history as an influence on much of whats been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film, certainly, should be dissuaded from watching it. to express a purely subjective judgement, however, i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people dont watch it its a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry. and by that i dont mean sick and angry about the human condition or anything so general and profound as that, because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty and so on and, if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort, then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself, however pessimistic his conclusions may be. my beef with the film is rather that i dont see this hourslong record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all. all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals alexandre to the greatest degree, of course, because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds marie perhaps to the least degree, because we see the least of her. alexandres affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value, of course, but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jeanpierre laud is most likely not even acting and that, with absurd remarks like un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray, he really was just reproducing wordforword opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he, along with the director eustache, had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film. i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100 of the film, it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow, worthless and despicable post68 milieu. what made, however, this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us. if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman, sleeping mostly in this very flat with another, and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third, well, i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dogeatdog world hes chosen to create for himself. what i cant, however, in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his anxiety and his despair. the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika, whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty. as i say, if la maman et la putain is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre, veronika and marie, three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home, then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being unflinching though why one should even feel like flinching once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i cant imagine. the problem, however, is that the director is clearly convinced and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics that alexander, veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings emotional capabilities. this latter idea, however, is arrant and offensive nonsense. there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular. but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work. it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated, miserable, and alone, or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter. watch la maman et la putain if youre historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post68 parisian milieu which was probably, unfortunately, not restricted to just a few particularly antisocial types like these. but please dont make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have.",0,5242,909

"well im probably about to be lambasted by everyone on this site, but the good earth is one of the worst structured films ive seen in a long time. we have a 2 and a half hour film that feels like its three and a half because it has two films in one. the first film tells the story of a family that has to move form their home because of drought and famine. they have to travel south to the cities to find food or work of some kind. conveniently they happen to find a bag of jewels and at the same time they find out that the drought has ended. yeah ok. with this knowledge they return home with their riches and everything is fine and wonderful again. br br well that takes about an hour and a half of film and while its incredibly lifeless at this point it does have a nice arc to it. you would think this would be a fantastic place to end the film. however, the film then continues on for a whole other hour. and in this remaining time, its takes a simple story about a family dealing with the hardships of the world and turns it into a sappy melodrama about betrayal and jealousy between lovers. oh yea and the age old, money is the root of all evil blah blah blah. just because you know your making an epic film doesnt mean that your story can go on needlessly for more than it has to. also the main idea i would gather about this film is that the earth is good to this family and holds them together. then why do we spend an hour telling a story about a rich man falling in love with another woman, and why is the final moment of the film dedicated to a wife that our main character hasnt even cared about through most of the film. br br oh wait and the film isnt the only thing thats poorly written, the main characters wife makes absolutely no sense. she complains a lot about how she was a slave and she never wants to have a slave and yadda yadda yadda. then why at the drop of a hat is she willing to sell her only daughter into slavery. even if they are starving at the time of this idea, it still doesnt make sense when 20 minutes later in the film she is complaining about not wanting a slave again. br br there are other films from the thirties that should be paid attention to. the only thing this one has going for it is the cinematography. the land is shot beautifully, oh and the sequence with the locusts is quite impressive. too bad that were in a film that had nothing to say. br br one last thing. i know that at this point in time hollywood was focused mostly on stars and they figured that a good actor can portray anything. for most of the film paul muni does portray an asian man to the best of his ability, but once it hits the half point where the film goes on for no reason he loses it and just becomes regular old italian paul, they even cut his hair so he looks like tony from scarfacealso a better film than this. of all the main characters in the film i think maybe three are actually asian, the rest are just americans being silly. oh and please ms. rainer that was a really nice one note performance, not, if i could i rip the oscar out of your hands, oh i would. br br the good earth is one epic waste of time. if you want something along this vain to watch on nice evening get the grapes of wrath, a film that truly deserves all the praise it gets. mainly because it wasnt written by a monkey.",0,3329,658

the original book of this was set in the 1950s but that wont do for the tv series because most people watch for the 1930s style. ironically the tube train near the end was a 1950s train painted to look like a 1930s train so the underground can play at that game too. hanging the storyline on a plot about the jarrow march was feeble but the 50s version had students who were beginning to think about the world around them so i suppose making them think about the poverty of the marchers is much the same thing. all the stuff about japp having to cater for himself was weak too but they had to put something in to fill the time. this would have made a decent half hour show or they could have filmed the book and made it a better long show. it is obvious this episode is a victim of style over content.,0,801,157

"i saw this film on its release, and have watched it 3 or 4 more times, including last week. i regret i have to be a voice of dissension with regard to mr. branaghs performance.br br this is really a glorious, sumptuous film, to say nothing of ambitious at over 4 hours long beautifully shot and designed. derek jacobi, julie christie, kate winslet, richard briers, and many others do fine jobs. then theres kenneth branagh. if ever there was a vanity project for an actor, this is it, and mr. branagh spares nothing in putting the ham in hamlet. from the stunt casting which gives us the worst performance ever by the woefully miscast jack lemmon, to the bits of distracting business thrown in to infuse a sense of naturalness, to his own performance which runs the gamut from throwing away the single most famous soliloquy in all of literature to screaming every line of others. his performance confirms that, while he may come across better on stage where bigger is necessary, he has never been a great film actor. the scenery budget could be charged to catering, mr. branagh eats so much of it. his performance is a perfect example of why people dont go to see shakespeare full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. and if there is fault to his direction, it is that he keeps the camera firmly glued on his overblown performance.br br no matter what theories people may posit on the bard, he was, after all is said and done, a playwright. the brilliance of his plays rest in the fact that his themes are universal and timeless. although there is no right way to play his plays, there is most certainly great acting, good acting and bad acting. shakespeare himself gives instructions to the players in the text of hamlet itself. it amazes me how mr. branagh mouthed it, but did not hear it. it was an example of spending too much time working out how hes going to say something, and too little figuring out what hes saying.br br while mr. branagh has certainly done a wonderful job in mounting some entertaining productions, he would be wise to stay behind the camera and allow those who know the art of acting to practice it. his direction has always been better than his acting. i still give him immense credit for resurrecting interest in filming shakespeare. he set a great template for other productions. and, it would be interesting to see him onstage, from about 20 rows back. but, i do hope he chooses to direct more and act less.br br is it worth seeing? certainly. there are many little joys to be found in the film. but, its a long, long movie and, by the end, one may feel less that they enjoyed than survived it.",0,2628,474

"i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal, in fact, it probably is still brutal today, but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly madefortv movie? also, womens rights were still budding in this nation during this time, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory, and still show the realism of the era would it make for good viewing? honestly, i dont know. i have thought about this film for the past two days, and i still cant seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film, yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasnt the greatest i have ever seen. from several hodgepodge styles of acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character, to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland. was it good? was it bad? that may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated! br br this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes. scenes where i wasnt sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole. i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale. i do not know much about living in wyoming, especially during the early 1900s, so this film captured that image in my mind. the thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this polaroidesquire view untouched by corporate america. it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience though the television. there were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattlebranding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that didnt survive their journey, that just brought a true sense of realism to this story. director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers, but i am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view.br br while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film, i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side. rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart, a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrells elinore randall. the two as actors have no chemistry at all. their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion. the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two veteran actors portrayed it. the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done. this is love? was it supposed to be love? i dont know, i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond, but with torn and ferrell, it felt like two actors just playing their parts. other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse knocks on the door for food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinores daughter i just didnt believe it, the lack of true winter struggle, and the entire land scene. the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing, why she was doing it, and why clyde would build her a house if they were married! it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a stronger film.br br overall, i will go middle of the road with this feature. there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore, but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation. these panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers. while there were some brilliant scenes of realism starring cattle and pigs, i just felt as if we needed more. depth was a key element lacking in this film, which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story. pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world, but instead left open loopholes and clichd western characters. ferrell carried her own, but torn was completely miscast. decent for a viewing, but will not be picked up again by me.br br grade out of",0,4422,788
"when converting a book to film, it is generally a good idea to keep at least some of the authors intended tone or conveyed concepts, rather than ignoring the author altogether. while it is clear that the director had access to and went on the advice of elinore stewarts children, it is key to note that the children believed their mother to be a complete liar in regards to the good, enriching, strengthening experiences of homesteading her land. the book details her life on her and her husbands adjoining homesteads in the vast wyoming frontier she chronicles daily adventures with her numerous friends and acquaintances, though they lived dozens of miles apart. the film, however, takes a standard stance for the time it was made, portraying this womans experience as harsh, unforgiving, and nearly pointless. perhaps the director was bringing some of his vietnam war experiences with him to this movie as some film aficionados have said, but it seems to be a lousy excuse for taking all the joy and beauty of the book and twisting it into a bleak, odious landscape devoid of friends or hope. dont waste your time with this movie read the book instead.",0,1155,199

"the same difficulty i have with the musical version of les miserables applies equally to oliver. instead of the composers writing in the stylistic period of the play settings, they merely wrote broadwaytype melodies, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed.br br too, the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score. its a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.br br the casting of the boy oliver doesnt help matters tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, theres something less than solid here. fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes hes obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.br br as long as he needs me is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. the two big production numbers, who will buy and consider yourself seem overproduced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. its one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess. br br the gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. while the novel is considered a classic, i must confess i have trouble with mr. dickens consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. br br not all the combined talent of this production, either on or behind camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material. all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me.br br",0,1646,273

"normally when i write a review for a movie online, it is for one of three reasons. either, i have found something exceptionally lacking in a film that otherwise would have been excellent, i feel that the publics perception of a film before viewing it is inaccurate for a number of reasons, or i believe that the purpose or message of a film needs to be clarified or explained with the help of other reviewers. while all of these reasons may appear to be somewhat negative, i find that writing a review that lavishes nothing but praise and statements such as, this is one of the best films of all time!, does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides, nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good, which should be the point of the review in the first place. with that being said, war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried, incompetent attempt at a money grab piggybacking its loathsome carcass on the multimillion dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg. many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject. this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing, rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger. now with most of the insults out of the way, allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than i. br br judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as sams club for 8 bucks, i assumed that the cast would be nonames and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular. check. this is not a big deal for me, as i find a large budget and an overreliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie. i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score. check again. what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alienbattle scenes. br br now, as per imdbs policy any spoilers must be announced in advance, no matter how small, so here is fair warning. the movie opens with a lot of inane smalltalk, followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot. seriously, it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube. it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth, but by the end of the first ten minutes, the combination of shaky camerawork, spliced scenes, and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer. however, the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going. the next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods, he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot. they both walk back to town. these walks arent two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged. they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie. in a particularly grueling scene, the main character is shown looking at a pod, then he is shown pacing and panting, then he looks at the pod, then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town, then comes in to town and walks into a building, then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee, then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building, then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod. i apologize for the extreme runon sentence, but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film. characters speak way too long about mundane things, they walk a lot, they send other people to walk, the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed, but for no dramatic effect, simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere. the editing is mindbogglingly bad. people actions make little sense. for instance, when the professor goes to a farmers house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town, the farmer stutters and paces around. when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside, the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later. nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene, as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk. the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film, but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion. i have seen better high school video productions. finally, the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story. i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage. however, it is so awful in technical aspects, and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad. avoid this film at all costs.",0,4954,930
"well, where to begin? i guess i can start with the general complaint regarding the way in which this film is marketed. call me ignorant for not knowing of schneebaums book before viewing the documentary that has been based off of it and decide that i have been living under some kind of a rock, but dont blame me for picking this movie up since the title and the description on the box makes no note of the fact that this documentary is actually a companion to said book. yeah, i felt quite stupid after viewing this little flick seeing as how the reason as to why i sat down to watch it in the first place was to get a good serving of a modern cannibal tale. i mean, am i a fool for expecting this film to actually cover most of its story on the behavior of cannibalism in jungle tribes? i certainly didnt expect an hour and fortyfive minutes of one old geezer kissing his own ass by whining about every little detail of his dull and worn out life. i certainly didnt expect the insipid directing and i most notably did not foresee myself laughing so hard at tobias schneebaum and all of his offputting glory.br br schneebaum is indeed unlikable. the old man just rambles and bitches the entire film making the whole picture a personal tale of his even though he isnt even that interesting a character to fill a story. oh really? he was a cannibal? ninety percent of the movie is focused on next to nothing regarding schneebaums dirty past. the only time that we really get to see some cannibal action is when tobias finally breaks his little silent treatment about what happened to him in peru and say that he had a small piece. thats it, folks. ninety minutes of bull later and tobias schneebaum is a cannibal by three inches. its like calling a movie the life of a true don juan only to see that the only the time the protagonist of said film did something sexual happened during college when he once played just the tip. unbelievable.br br the directing is, indeed, superbly ghastly as there is no flow or rhythm to the story that is being told. alright, i understand that i didnt read schneebaums volume before watching his celluloid tale of it, but i can still recognize some bad pacing and even worse editing. one minute schneebaum is talking about cruise ships and tourism and the next hes going on and on about how he cant drive and then jumps to talking about some dead relative or some failed and miserable saga in his life. i mean, jesus, can you at least slam his back story to the first part follow up with some stuff covering his homosexuality and then end it off with a hearty look into his visit to peru? also i dont particularly care much for schneebaums insipid little quips on life and living, but i at least implore the old man to keep consistent with his ramblings. if i hear a guy talking about how he prefers life in the jungle i dont expect him to suddenly bitch and moan about wanting to go back home twenty minutes later. absurd.br br another note on the directing is the random clips from the story at hand to the small little television appearances in which our hero has appeared. while some might find the clips to be fancy little breaks from the story, the director has overused the gimmick and broken his entire film into pieces by seemingly attempting to place most of the efforts of telling the story on the old reels.br br the bottom line, here, is that tobias schneebaum is a fraud. pure and simple. i know that i havent read the book, but im still holding on to the argument that this film is totally useless by noting that a good film must stand on its own. this documentary relies way too much on the assumption that the viewer is already an avid fan of schneebaums work and instead goes on from that assumption like a supplemental disk found on a dvd. schneebaum is both arrogant and bitchy, striking a sour combination when mixed with the fact that his story is remarkably unriveting. if youre looking for a solid piece on the nature of humans and cannibalism, turn away because keep the river to your right is an embarrassingly hilarious selfserving rant over a man who is long overdue for a straightjacket and a gag.",0,4159,766

"when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit, as the plot takes on quite complex issues. using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach. still unfortunately, despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture, adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gayslesbians, it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film. this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle, attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with.br br however, this does not mean that the film is directly bad, as its rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing. the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter, but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep. this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts. by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation.br br even if the film does at no point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama, the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when the ball drops. this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard clich that becomes ridiculous in its happyending. nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending. so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages, one cant help but roll eyes towards the resolution. personally i was close to shouting finish already!! at the screen.br br there were some decent acting in the film, and the two young female central characters had some good moments. so did their parents and other bicharacters. however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting, that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism. he didnt even appear very likable, but rather self involved despite his good deeds, which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained.br br i give the film a 4, as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from. the script and cast had many good believable characters, giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others. had the letdowns not been this disappointing, id easily give the film a 7 or 8. if you enjoyed this film, id recommend the film east is east, which i think is an as good, if not better rendering of cultural conflict, as well as being amusing and engaging.",0,2740,476

"i didnt know whether to laugh or cry at this misrepresentation of canadian history, particularly the disservice done to the history of the mounted police in the yukon.br br ill leave it to pierre berton, noted historian, born and raised in dawson city yukon, and author of the definitive history of the klondike gold rush, klondike the last great gold rush, 18961899 to express my exasperation with this silly movie br br the american idea of an untamed frontier, subdued by individual heroes armed with sixguns, was continued in the far country, another story about a cowboy from the american west wyoming this time driving his herd of beef cattle into gold country. the picture is a nightmare of geographical impossibilities, but the real incongruity is the major assumption on which the plot turns that there was only one mounted policeman in all of the canadian yukon at the time of the gold rush and that he could not deal with the lawlessness. when james stewart and walter brennan reach the yukon border with their cattle, the customs shack is empty.br br where is the constable? asks brennan.br br up on the pelly river. trouble with the chilkats, someone replies. hes got a real tough job, that constable. he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles. sometimes he dont get home for two or three months at a time. br br the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen. the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike. they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense. they collected customs duties, often over the wails of the new arrivals, made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation, and turned men back if they didnt have enough supplies, or if they simply looked bad. in true canadian fashion, they laid down moral laws for the community. in dawson the lords day act was strictly observed it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday and plump young women were arrested for what the sternfaced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre, generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights.br br in such a community, a gunbelt was unthinkable. one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable, who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly. the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman, upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over. no man has yet taken a gun away from me, said the american. well, im taking it, the constable said mildly and did so, without further resistance. so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece.br br in 1898, the big year of the stampede, there wasnt a serious crime let alone a murder in dawson. the contrast with skagway on the american side, which was a lawless town run by soapy smith, the denver confidence man, was remarkable. but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law, which a soapy smith character from skagway he is called gannon in the picture can easily control. in real life, one of smiths men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant.br br in the movie the lone mountie says yes im the law. i represent the law in the yukon territory. about fifty thousand square miles of it.br br then why arent there more of you?br br because yesterday this was a wilderness. we didnt expect you to pour in by the thousands. now that youre here, well protect you.br br when?br br therell be a post established here in dawson early in may.br br what happens between now and may?

"you know all those letters to father christmas and jesus that are sent every year? well, it turns out that they are not actually delivered but dropped off in a halfforgotten corner of the post office to rot unless some bright spark figures out a way of posting them. as bizarre settings go, its a winner and one which perfectly fits the strange movie that is dead letter office. having said that, this is obviously an australian film as opposed to a british one. if it was royal mail, most letters get this sort of treatment anyway. i havent been in this flat for two years and were still getting letters for a mr wang, some female priest of the church of latter day iveneverheardofyou and various catalogues for industrial equipment addressed to a plumbing company.br br dead letter office the name given to the place where undeliverable mail ends up follows the story of alice miranda otto who grows up in a seriously divided home. writing to her absent father, she only learns in adulthood that her letters havent been delivered for one reason or another. so, logically, she gets a job at the d.l.o. and finds herself working alongside other social rejects including the brooding chilean immigrant frank lopez george del hoyo. slowly, she finds herself drawn to him but can she find out where her dad is without bringing the selfcontained world of the dead letters office to its knees?br br nothing against this film but i was reminded of the godawful heather graham film committed while watching this. however, this is so much better than that pile of horse crap but then again, that aint difficult. for a start, this film is much more logical. true, the metaphors are somewhat blatant and the underflowing symbolism quickly becomes a flood. but at least this is cohesive and quirky without being complete drivel. it is also well acted. both otto and del hoyo are very good as the lovers looking for something they know theyll never find while other characters are peripheral at best. part of the trouble is that it seems to wrap up far too quickly, leaving this viewer somewhat disappointed. the other part is that when you consider australias draconian immigration policy i.e. if you dont speak english, rack off!, such a story is unlikely to take place in reality. the other characters, sadly, also help to destabilise the realism by proving to be little more than oddball stereotypes.br br despite that, dead letter office is certainly something a little different. it might not be to everyones taste but i liked it. yes, it was hackneyed and predictable but sometimes, its nice to watch a film without guns or violence or heavyduty swearing and nudity no chance of that in an australian film. there aint any major laughs, theres no bullet time and the characters are usually onedimensional. but its the story that counts here and while its not earthshattering in its magnificence, its a pleasant enough way of passing the time. its the movie equivalent of a sheryl crow cd nice to listen to now and again but you wouldnt really miss it if it wasnt there.",0,3063,533

"extremely disappointing film based on the james michener novel.br br what was even worse was marlon brandos performance. his southern drawl was ridiculous. i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. tyrone power, in witness for the prosecution, should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here.br br the film, dealing with racism, dealt with the u.s. governments attempt to avoid marriages between u.s. soldiers and japanese women.br br brando was stonefaced throughout the movie. his moving from antithese relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman. his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.br br only the lord knows why red buttons and miyoshi umeki received supporting oscars for their performances. nothing about either performance was equally impressive. umekis appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. a better performance in this film was done by miiko taka, who did nicely as brandos love interest. she showed great emotion as the antiamerican who found love with the brando character. her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11. she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.br br martha scott went from the hebrew mother yochobel in the ten commandments to the bigoted mother of brandos love interest at first. her performance together with the one of ricardo montalban was wasted. patricia owens, as brandos first love, showed depth and conviction in her performance.",0,1750,291
"kubrick meets king. it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, i remember. then the movie came out, and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since.br br the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it. the kubrick cultists dont give a damn about kings story. they talk about steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles.this is a film, they insist it should be considered on its own. as it happens, both camps are correct. unfortunately.br br if one views it purely as an adaptation of kings novel, the shining is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of botched narrative gambits. br br i used to blame that on kubricks screenwriter. the writer diane johnson author of le marriage, laffaire, le divorce, etc. has a reputation as an novelist of social manners. maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics. but the little bluecollar town of sidewinder, colorado doesnt exist on any map in her francophile universe. br br kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial, however. he, of course, is the real auteur. and considered on its own merits, his screenplay for the shining with its mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation just doesnt stand up to logical analysis.br br im willing to consider kubricks shining on its own terms. im even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horrorgenre movie. but it doesnt succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness either. parsed either way, the film pretty much falls apart.br br are the horrors of the overlook hotel real? or do they exist only in the mind first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father? one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a ghost he is in fact looking into a mirror. one notes how the hotels frozen topiaryhedge maze appears to symbolize jacks stunted, convoluted psyche. very deep stuff.br br but if indeed the overlooks ghosts are purely manifestations of jack torrances growing insanity, then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchens deadbolted walk in closet, so that he can go on his climactic axwielding rampage?br br and can anyone explain, with a straight face, that blackandwhite photograph helpfully labelled 1921 of nicholson as a tuxedoed partygoer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotelballroom wall during the films closing seconds? are we to seriously conclude that jack torrances bad craziness stems from a some sort of past life experience? and if you swallow that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?br br maybe kubrick didnt care about his storyline. maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror. whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets to have it both ways, rational and supernatural. as a result, the story is a mess. this movie hasnt improved with age, and it certainly doesnt improve with repeated viewings.br br i dont deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia, and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long, long film. but those gushing elevators o blood, seen repeatedly in little dannys visions, are absurd and laughable. and jack torrances infamous tag lines wendy, im home! and heeeeeeres johnny! merely puncture the movies dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy. i know i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief whew! glad we dont have to take this stuff seriously! finally, kubrick is completely at sea or else utterly cynical during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son. a foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? yikes, now i really am afraid.br br given jack nicholsons brilliance over the years, one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeballrolling, eyebrowwiggling, scenerychomping performance that the director wanted. the performance of shelley duvall, as a sort of female version of don knotts in the ghost and mr. chicken, is best passed over in silence.br br this movie simply doesnt succeed not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. it probably merits a 3 out of 10, but im giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely overrated in this forum.",0,4420,741
"loyalty to peter falk is all that kept me from giving this awful picture the 1 it deserved. for that matter, loyalty to mr. falk was what kept me watching this film all the way from heads to tails. even if you forgive all the glaring errors, this was just plain the poorest excuse for a madefortv columbo film ever. im glad i watched it on tv for free would have hated to have coughed up the bucks for a print.",0,410,81
"youre not going to shoot those little creatures. in the first place, they havent done you any harm. in the second place, they may be radioactive. ah, the joys of nobudget 50s scifi yet despite the odd gem like that, superman and the molemen is pretty uninspiring going even with a lean 58minute running time. its beyond cheap the one shot of superman flying is an incredibly inept few frames of animation and pretty dull with it, though it has a surprisingly altruistic message the mute molemen, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like mr mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and george reeves man of steel tries to prevent the local smalltown mob led by jeff corey from killing them. an interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with little more than good intentions to recommend it.",0,951,160
