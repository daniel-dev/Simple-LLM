"ok, if youre looking for another bastketball diaries, this is completely the wrong film.br br i revolves around two brothers. max, the younger, has a major cocaine addiction. adam, the eldest, is a doctor. this movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible. it however, does not. it shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present. most of the movie focus is on max and his parting ways. eventually adam, can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well perscription drugs.br br this movie has almost no climax. doesnt descend into what cocaine really does to you, has boring and lowbudget scenes, and the acting of the eldest brother, adam, is horrific.br br i have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards, it is not a heartwencher. if you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs rent, if not buy the basketball diaries. and notice the difference.br br try to avoid this movie but, if you think you will enjoy. try and see for yourself...",0,1086,198
"despite its stereotypes, virtually noname cast and an obviously low budget i thought this film was alright much better than i expected it to be. i was skeptical at first the idea of a computer virus that can also infect people seemed a little ludicrous to me. but in the end, i thought the film handled the concept well even if some scenes were a little clichd.br br the cast was quite good, and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. i couldnt help thinking, though, that janine turner is a bit of a geena davis lookalike. maybe its just her face or the makeup, hair and clothes she had in this movie but it just kept nagging at the back of my mind the whole time.br br while its not a must see or a great film by any standard, fatal error is an entertaining flick that will keep you watching until the end.",0,826,158

"as a single woman over 40, i found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. it was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a chick flick, and it failed miserably. andy mcdowell isnt much of an actress to begin with, but given the nonexistent plot i hate to even refer to it as a plot in this, she didnt have a chance. there was no character development, no reason to feel sympathyempathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. and then theres the obligatory malefantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try please.br br not only do i wish i could get my money back for the dvd rental, i also want those 112 minutes of my life back. what a ripoff.",0,827,156

"the invisible man is a fantastic movie from 1933, a cutting edge film for its time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible. go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like childs play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. the special effects in hollow man, the update of the hg wells story, are ok, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by paul verhoeven, who you might remember from showgirls and total recall. kevin bacon plays sebastian caine, a scientist dabbling in the world of bioinvisibilation yeah, i know thats not a word but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the teams funding. so, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation yeah, i know, i used that nonword again process. the process has dire consequences, no caine does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. now that hes invisible, caine stalks a sexy neighbor, a coworker, former girlfriend linda elisabeth shue, and the man who took away his funding. then a funny thing happens, caine becomes a new supernatural being, the thing that wont die. laughing in the face of all things natural, caine faces down death and spits in its face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. the movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. there are neat possibilities in hollow man, but of course, not one of them is explored. for a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good oldfashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 invisible man. kevin bacon will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a volcano.",0,2067,368

"ill indicate in this review the point where spoilers begin. my dissatisfaction is split 30 tonedeafness, 70 lackluster writing.br br the 30 i agree with the first commenters synopsis about the lack of diversity in the characters and scope of the stories. i was surprised how, this film, at best, woefully shortchanges the real nyc by presenting a collection of people and relationships so narrow as to come across as if its inhabited only by the cast of gossip girl this is coming from someone who likes gossip girl. a few minority characters are written into the stories, but they are included by obligation, while we can see the gears under the film so clearly, striving to be diverse but falling eversoshort.br br the 70 is why everything falls short. all characters, white plus a few token minorities, are onedimensional, cardboard cutouts of people concepts. worse, their interactions with each other are scripted in such a way that for each vignette in the film the audience is treated to what id say is a gag we get a basic conceit, then some punchline intended to be a clever twist. but even if we suspended cynicism for a moment to say, okay, that was a surprise...the stories are still not that interesting, because they, too, are shallow. when you fashion stories so that their existence hinges solely on the unexpectedness of the ending, youre writing jokes.br br spoilers below...br br the movie primarily tries to tell romantic stories. thats fine. but romance is amazing, deep, sometimes complex. these romantic stories each feature a girl and a boy who at some point share the same location and get to look at each other. words exchange, thoughts are projected through voiceover, but they too only manage to communicate to the audience merely that one person is attracted to another.br br meaning, there is no seduction in the broad sense, no tension, and neither confrontation nor communion between the wills of two different people trying to reconcile their existence to accommodate the other. the only story involving a superficial seduction is told just so the audience ends up being surprised that the guy ethan hawke gets outwitted by the girl hes hitting on, who unexpectedly turns out to be a hooker. sure, his words when trying to pick her up are interesting to hear and we are amused as wed be if we were next to them, but there is nothing of substance to this story outside of a then b. so it unfolds, if something like a postcard could unfold, with all the other tales as well a then bthats it, the only point being that these happen to occur on set in manhattan. by the way, the only brooklyn we see is the coney island sketch the only queens is the flickering of a train ride taken by a character traveling to the west village.br br its easy to pick at movies that play into all the common stereotypes of race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on. new york, i love you, however, deserves to be held to stricter scrutiny because of its title. we expect to see the real new york, and real new yorkers, but instead we have paraded before us the selected slice of a demographic, its characters flown in from the o.c., plus a few others to make it seem as if we are paying attention to diversity. but when we look closer at who those characters are, the whole sham becomes an affront to the very notion of diversity and the ethnicities and cultures the movie shamefully fails to represent.br br for example, the story with the latino man with the little white girl in the park, who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny male nanny when in fact hes the father. notwithstanding the last scene of this part was unnecessary from a dramaticconstruction point of view it would have been far more interesting to end it when the mother and boyfriendstepfather are strutting the girl away, it is frankly a bit disgusting that the scene where we learn for sure that the girls father is latino also must inform us that he is a sexually desirable dancer. what, the dad cant be just some guy from south america? now that hes obviously hot, is the audience better prepared to accept that he had a kid with a middletoupperclass white woman? are we that naive as to require such? as if a mexican construction worker would obviously be too unpalatable.br br its not my place to dictate where the movie should have gone. but in every conceivable setup and plot twist, the direction taken screams status quo, appeals to safety. all these stories could have been made more interesting, even if we were forced to keep the singledimensionality of the characters inhabiting them, at the very least by not choosing from standard and obvious stereotypes. asian girl living in chinatown being leered at by a scraggly old white guy? how bout an asian cougar pursuing a white college kid instead. again, im not saying the entire conceit has to be changed. its just that every. damn. story premise. is so hackneyedand thus they fail to convey anything about why one might love new york, outside the trite. the real way to have improved the film would be to have written a script worth reading.br br i will concede the pleasantness of the soundtrack, the good pacing of the movie even if what was being paced was, well, dredge, and the general feel of many of the scenes. the movie was just fine to sit through, and i wouldnt dissuade anyone from doing so. however, it is telling that the most significant homage paid to nonsuperficiality is when the old opera singer says paraphrased thats what i love about new york everyones from a different place. well, you wouldnt know it from watching this one.",0,5601,989
"i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywoodnot very bignames in it. interested enough i decide to give it a shot later.. it was a tough to bear experience believe me. then, after finally seeing the credits roll i tought we turks really suck at hollywood style film making.. this is an insult to the heisthostage movie genre.. but then wait! i checked some names and no, they were not turkish names and no, this was not a turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director crew! that made me thinkingagain! how on earth can you persuade names like micheal madsen, edward furlong or even arnold vosloo to take part in such a project? with money probably.. that kept me thinking further.. how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast? then all my meditation paid off and i came to find the answer.by hiring the cheapest equipment and crew that you can find. and if you still have to difficulty in adjustin your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produceor vice versa i dont have any information on that. so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as.. it makes you think in my case even meditate and there are a lot of movies outthere that doesnt give even that affect.. this one at least makes you think it makes you wonder.. it leaves you with disbelief.. and then it makes you wonder again..",0,1498,275

"i am curious yellow is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. it doesnt matter what ones political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic nc17, that isnt true. ive seen rrated films with male nudity. granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the rrated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? nowhere, because they dont exist. the same goes for those crappy cable shows schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny, in which were treated to the site of vincent gallos throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on chloe sevigny. before crying or implying doublestandard in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. in fact, you generally wont see female genitals in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. this alleged doublestandard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of womens bodies.",0,1271,214

"when a man who doesnt have alzheimers cant remember how many films hes made, he probably is the worlds most prolific director after all. that man is jesus franco, the king of socalled eurotrash. his 1980 flick devil hunter is as rushed, opaque, stupid, lazy and exploitative in the truest sense of the word the films title is misleading, for starters as any other franco film ive seen. that makes it sound pretty awful, and it is... yet franco does have some kind of inimitable sensibility, a generous way with the baldly outrageous, with nudity and sleaze and violence, and even with his stupid cheap editing which tries to pave over the extreme haste with which all his films were made. the mix of all these elements causes you to ride his films out, even while youre mostly waiting for them to end because theyre so very tedious.br br devil hunter is nigh on incomprehensible for the first half an hour. the kidnap by strangers of a white woman who seems to be a model or film star is intercut with a bunch of native action in south america. theres lots of naked writhing, dancing, and endless repeated zoomins on an ugly totem pole. you need to get used to the repetitive zoomins and the technique of cutting back to the same shot about three times in a row right away, as these are francos main methods of extending a film out to feature length.br br the monster who looks like the totem pole is actually kind of scary. he has raw bug eyes and his presence is always signalled on the soundtrack by cacophonous groaning, apparently recorded in an echo chamber. early in the piece he chews on a native lady strapped to a tree, and its hard to know what really happens here but i think he ate her stomach or her genitals, sweet jesus!.br br anyway, the adventure begins properly when a studly guy and his freaked out vietnam vet pal are sent to the island to recover the white girl from the kidnappers. the flakey guy has an accent which, as dubbed, is half brooklynamerican, half englishliverpudlian and all retarded. all of the dialogue and dubbing is ridiculous and laughable, making for another layer of the film which can somehow hold your interest.br br not too much really happens from here on in, and it happens pretty sluggishly, studded with the odd bit of outrage like a rape. the nebulous action is fleshed out haha! by acres of 360 degree nudity from the natives and the two female leads, and even from the monster himself. that he walks around with his penis exposed makes wrestling him an unappetising prospect for the tough guy hero, but its gotta be done at some point, and its nice to note that the director will show anyones genitals on camera.br br the best feature of devil hunter is the location filming. franco can be extremely cheap with the structural and story aspects of filmmaking, but he doesnt muck around with sets. you get real islands, jungles, helicopters and mountains, all in widescreen. this is something that is really cool to experience in these days of crappy cgi sets and backdrops ad nauseam.br br ultimately, issues of recommendation where this film is concerned seem moot. if youre trying to see all the video nasties, you will have to watch this at some point, and youll be made as restless as i was. if you like franco, youll watch this anyway. if you fall into neither of the above categories, the odds are youll never come across this film. copies of it arent just lying around, and i could hardly recommend the seeking out of it. its franco. lazy, crazy franco.",0,3512,629

"before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube, i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to rewatch something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980 barbara bachs cleavage. and since the movie received an r rating, i expected to see her nude. alas, no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here stacey nelkin whos supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this. seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as ms. bach. they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides. in fact, i dont blame ron leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tightfisted liceman is pretty embarrassing though i did like the seduction scene he did with ms. nelkin. this also happens to be the debut of ralph macchio whos the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school. the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms. bach, an arab who worships motor oil, and a politicians son who loves his girlfriend candy nelkins character so much, he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy. among the supporting cast, tom poston plays a swishy character named sisson who i found partly amusing. with a screenplay by tom patchett and jay tarses and direction by robert downey sr. whose son robert downey jr. has a cameo early on in a soccer scene, up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless youre really offended at the scatological and sexual content, this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boyalfred e. newmanshouldnt be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture...p.s. another one of the misfits was harry teinowitz who was born in my birth town of chicago, ill. he played rodney ververgaert. he also says one of my favorite lines im trying to come.",0,1933,353

"i am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators. to me it was rather a disappointment, especially the combination of historical facts, fantasy and the main characters internal turmoil does not work at all in vonneguts book slaughterhouse five and even in george roy hills adaptation for the screen it does. credibility is often overstretched. too many questions are left open. did i miss some central points? or did i fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots? br br a boy called campbell, jr., grows up in upstate new york. at home his father has many technical trade papers and one book. it has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it. the boy leafs through the book, his dad doesnt like his doing that. what should this tell me? the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin. bang. it is 1938, the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright. what kind of plays does he write? in what language? is he successful? his wife is an actress and looks glamorous. the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same. he does not. why? because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american? because he is successful? because his wife is? because he likes his life there? because he likes the nazis? because he is just plain lazy and doesnt like change? dont ask me.br br possibly, the man just does not care, is not interested in politics, is a kind of an existentialist. he states that he is deeply in love with his wife. he speaks of his republic of two meaning he and his wife. there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie, it much more seems a republic of one.br br on the request of an american agent campbell, jr., agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines. the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short, unexciting and anti climactic, the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation, the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.br br so now we have campbell, jr., presenting himself over the air as the last free american. the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting although one wonders what happened when campbell, jr., really and honestly had to cough, hiccup etc. must have scrambled the messages terribly. anyway, the nazis lose, the wife dies touring in the crimean for german troops i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii, campbell, jr., says he goes to the russian front but does not go, is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug how come?, is dragged to a sightseeing tour in auschwitz, is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york.br br and this is where the story really starts br br bang. from now on it is like a short story by paul auster. it is 1961, campbell, jr., lives in new york tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife. nobody really cares or do they? yes, somehow they do, and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. auschwitz survivors. a painter. some american supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead. they even find his presumed dead wife for him, or is she his wife? anyway, in the end campbell, jr., calls in at the israeli consulate, and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment, placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmanns. he writes his life story and, once this task finished, hangs himself on the typewriters ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.br br while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss, i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. amazingly, many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero, having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american. i assume according to them this took a lot of courage. as a matter of fact, however, the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a winwin situation, as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story.br br one might argue, that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. but even then it fails to make a point, primarily, i suspect, because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat. this is a pity, especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee, a talented, versatile and sensuous actress. she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent. another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession, broadcast and hidden messages, but i guess this is largely unfilmable. maybe i should give the book a chance.",0,5228,934

"this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. his characters constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script. the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison. unfortunately, sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. the majority of the films jokes come from sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because hes too ugly and cant get women. the film is hard to watch too because it doesnt treat itself like a real film. sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the films low budget or questionable content. the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin sandlers career. pass this one up at the video store, i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.",0,1232,216
"if youve ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says, jesus is the answer. whats the question?, then perhaps you should thank god if youve never met a lacanian. slavoj zizek, the most evangelical of lacanians, would surely exchange the word jesus in that statement for lacanhegel.br br zizeks star burns brightly at the moment, no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption. so it seems impressive when someone anyone comes along and says, hang on, films may say something about ourselves.br br the ideas zizek expounds in this film are true purely because he says so. for example, zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego, superego and id god knows what happened to zeppo, or gummo perhaps theyre the sinthome...or is that movies themselves?. this is simply what they are. in zizeks output, culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology. people may object that he certainly has something to say but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to gods will?br br whats wrong with taking examples, from films or anywhere, to illustrate theory? well, nothing at all. as zizek seems to believe, they may even serve as a proof. however, it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context. without context, you can say and prove anything you want. for zizek, lacan is the answer so he goes and makes an example of it. everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out, to serve this ideology. for instance, zizeks exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop. but, in the context of the film, this is not a voyeurs fantasy position at all. stewart has been deliberately led there by novak. this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizeks two hour and a half cinematic sermon.br br his analysis of the baby wants to f scene in blue velvet is laughable. touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific to the masculine truth of feminine jouissance, zizek says that isabella rossilinis character not only demands her degradation but is, unconsciously, in charge of the situation. this is an example of her jouissance. well ... possibly. but sorry to be prosaic where is the evidence for this? in the film, she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son. zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan. but this may be due to any number of things. isnt that the point of socalled feminine jouissance? according to lacan, feminine jouissance, unlike phallic jouissance, cannot be articulated, it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language. if this is right, then no example can be made of it. it also means that the entire concept is nonsensical and entirely mystical. it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek theres feminine jouissance for you! why is this feminine jouissance? because i say so. br br what example can really be garnered from these films? only zizeks psychology. why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films, even to the point that, when in a boat on botega bay, he says he wants to f rod steiger too? is this not the wishfulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films? as the saying goes, freud would have a field day with the perverts guide to the cinema but with zizek himself, nobody else.br br zizeks theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it, but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws. this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely as to be almost useless how the rest of us desire. for, as any psychoanalyst knows, how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated and cannot be easily universalised, if at all. zizeks love of making everything an example of lacans answer bears this out how do we desire? like this, this is how i do it. problem is, in zizeks desire, everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire. but zizek is a leninist and they certainly dont like letting the subject speak for itself.br br the perverts guide to the cinema is a summation zizeks love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political what dogma isnt?. zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis, what he is trying to discover, because the terms of his exploration, and therefore his ethics in doing so, are never put into question.br br zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing. hes a kind of henry ford of cultural theory massproduction and any colour as long as its black. he is perfect for todays highly consumerist society supposedly critical while giving people the same cap over and over and pretending that it is something different. this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems which capitalism always claims to provide rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all. which is kind of like being brain dead. for me, zizeks third matrix pill is a suicide capsule.br br ps i loved zizeks solemn remark presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity that music in films can greatly affect peoples sympathies. did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws?",0,5558,955

"save the 8.97 youll spend at walmart to buy this dvd and go see the real film by steven spielberg.br br im a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of h.g. wells, i had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. instead, it took four days to finish watching this because i couldnt stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time. its horrible.br br there are reports that timothy hines had a 20 million budget for this production. where the heck did it go? did he use most of it to buy a new house? finance his retirement? or what? let me start with what is actually good about this film. it does stay true to the book and there are a few good performances in it. i can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film. but good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible... and i do mean horrible special effects. any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the cgi. to me, most of it looked like stop action card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated cgi software that a 20 million project should be using.br br theres no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film. my own partner and i sat down and recreated our version of the ferry scene using software that cost less than 1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what hines created. ive seen films with budgets of less than 2 million look better. much better.br br in my opinion the special effects used in the original king kong were more sophisticated and better than hines special effects in this film. in fact, i have a much better appreciation for attack of the killer tomatoes because of this film. theres no excuse with todays technology for a film to look like a 50s bmovie unless that was the intention, which shouldnt have been with this particular project.br br a problem i had with the dvd transfer was that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur filmmaking.br br overall, i have to say that i produced a 45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film.br br i strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good filmmaking or who is a fan of wotw to leave this film on the shelf and watch attack of the 50 foot woman instead. it would be easier on the eyes.",0,2348,431

"a model named laura is working in south america when she is kidnapped from her hotel room by a gang and taken into the jungle. they demand a huge ransom for her release. peter is hired to get her home safe and there is a bonus in it for him if he can bring back the money as well as the girl. peter is taken to the jungle by helicopter with friend jack. they try to give the kidnappers fake money in return for laura but the plan goes horribly wrong and they have to bail out in the helicopter. the helicopter is shot and they also have to bail from that not going well so far. also roaming the jungles is a devil of sorts. in reality its just a naked black guy with weirdly big eyes and a breathing problem. he starts to kill a few of the kidnappers and laura escapes only to be captured by some primitives. the rest of the film is a bit of a blur really.br br now im not a massive jess franco fan, in fact to date this is only the second film of his i have seen, but even i can tell that this really isnt one of his best efforts. the films drags along at a pretty slow pace without much at all happening. the whole thing could have been edited down quite easily into a 25 minute tv show. there are plenty of overly long shots of people walking through the jungle that could have just been lifted straight out.br br devil hunter is poorly lit infact i dont think it was lit at all, badly dubbed, poorly acted and slow yet for some reason it didnt bore me. i think the main reason for this was some of the hilariously bad scenes in it. for example a scene where laura is walking in the street was obviously shot in a real street as crowds of people stop to stare straight at the camera as its shooting. another funny scene has one of the gang who has been killed, hung in a tree dripping blood as one of his friends stands directly under him screaming for what seems like minutes. then for no reason at all the man in the trees head just falls of and hits the guy under him. it has to be seen to be believed. then of course there is the actual devil. it is just some naked black guy who despite the fact he has massive eyes, he has very blurry vision.br br the film was hooked up in part of the video nasty scare in the 80s here in the uk and was banned. now why it was i have no idea. there is very little gore at all and its hardly a shocking film. minus the nudity i would have said that it could get away with a pg almost. the only thing i can think of is that it was never actually watched and was added to the original list because of word of mouth.br br there is not much reason to watch this film really unless you are a massive jess franco fan. there is plenty of nudity to keep you from falling asleep and also some scenes that are so bad you can have a good laugh at them but other wise i would say just pay for a ticket to south america and get lost in a jungle. it would probably be more fun.br br 310",0,2914,589
