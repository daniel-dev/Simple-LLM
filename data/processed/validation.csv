"creep your journey terminates here. some very graphic scenes and...well, yeah, thats about all for this film.br br no real plot, no storyline. no likable characters, well, characters isnt correct considering you dont have a clue who anyone really is. i mean, they are being chased by some weird looking thing in the sewers who is this thing? why is he there?, thats quite scary i guess, but do i really care? no, i dont. why dont i? because i dont have a clue who these people are and i dont know if i should want them to live or die. its one dimensional and relies upon gore and sound effects to scare you, which it rarely does.br br this film lacks any meaning, any purpose. it feels like i fell asleep and missed out the 45mins of build up. it jumps right into the action. basically, some women and her friends get locked in the london underground, get chased by a weird creature, then they eventually escape from it.br br creep has its moments which make you jump, the art is good, the location is excellent and the sounds are ok, but that isnt what makes a decent horror film, so unfortunately all that goes to waste.br br its nothing new. another predictable modern horror, where kate the lead character consistently does the stupid hey, i know you lot sitting at home think i should do the sensible thing in this situation, but, oooh no! im going to do the total opposite because im a dumb blond thing. i wish they wouldnt do that, its done so many times, its boring and gets predictable. in fact, im pretty annoyed the silly woman didnt get stabbed by the, erm, grey alienlooking creature.br br your journey terminates here is the films tag line. well, creeps journey terminates only a short while into the film. if youve had a few beers, got a couple of mates back at yours,then sure, watch it by all means. but if you want something original and clever, avoid.",0,1870,342

"this movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. it should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. the worst problem is the acting. you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, richard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple, although both normally do fine work. the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at allthey are inconsistent and unbelievable. much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english. the casting is ludicrous. why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable marcel, has pronounced african features, including an obviously dyed blond fro? its as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. its just so weird! this could be a great movie and should be remade, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. there are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals, daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.",0,1516,254

"wow...br br i picked this up at the local walmart after reading online that it had been released early. ive been following this online for some time, and just had to buy the film.br br wow...br br i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing, or lack thereof. time and again, characters usually the narrator and whoever he is with are shown walking...and walking...and walking. i am not an editor, but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b. there is no need to show almost the entire journey! wow...br br i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this. they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy, depending on what action was to be added at a later date.br br wow...br br why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me. even ilm still employs miniatures sometimes. one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant rushing about of according to the end credits the same group of people representing the citizenry of different towns and cities, including london. at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera. in one shot in london, there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the narrators brother played by star anthony piana without his distracting mustache. not since gettysburg have i seen such a fake piece of facial hair.br br wow...br br why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me. it is a turkey, plain and simple. on the plus side at least for me it has provided some of the most genuine laughoutloud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while.",0,1803,337

"sometime in 1998, saban had acquired the rights to produce a brandnew ninja turtles liveaction series. naturally, being a fan of the tmnt back in the day, this obviously peaked my interest. so when i started watching the show... to say i was disappointed by the end result is an understatement. some time later more like recently, i got a chance to revisit the series.br br first off, lets talk about some of the positives. they managed to recreate the turtles lair as it was last seen in the movies fairly well given the limited budget they threw in with this. there tends to be this darker atmosphere overall in terms of the sets and whatnot. and the turtle suits, while not the greatest piece of puppetry and whatnot, were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series.br br people tend to complain about getting rid of shredder quickly and replacing him with these original villains who could have easily been used in a power rangers show. but you can only have shredder get beat so many times before it gets boring and undermines his worth as a villain... and besides, most fans dont realize or dont remember or just plain ignore the fact that in the original comic, the shredder was offed in the very first issue! never mind the countless resurrections that would follow. so on a personal standpoint, i was sort of glad they got rid of shredder because then the anticipation would build to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode. i find that shredder in small quantities work best because then his encounters with the turtles are all the more memorable.br br unfortunately, they end up replacing him with these original villains who, as stated, seemed more fit for a power rangers show than a ninja turtles show. and with these new magicwielding generics comes a new female magicwielding turtle, the infamous venus de milo. ill be honest i never got comfortable with her. im not against the idea of a female turtle im just against the idea of one who uses magic and thus sticks out like a sore sight among a clan of ninja turtles who seem somewhat out of their domain. i almost get the impression that this could have easily been the venus de milo show dealing with her makebelieve enemies and the tmnt are just there to provide the star power or whatever was left considering the timeframe this was released. fortunately, they all share the spotlight together.br br next mutation was canned after a season on the air and the creators were more than happy to ignore it. given time and maybe another season, i really believe this live iteration of the tmnt could have been something and might have gotten a chance at greatness. but while the idea was sound, the execution was flawed although there are a couple good episodes in this series. as it stands, next mutation is one of those oddities in turtledom that is best left buried and forgotten.",0,2935,520
"i am compelled to write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money. almost any episode of desmond morris the human animal or david suzukis the nature of things could have bested the material presented. not only does the director fail to make use of imaxs incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen, everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously. viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather, her husband buster, and their niece and nephew. we follow them for an interminable fortyodd minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies natural diving reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most gradeschool graduates? are we even remotely entertained by the transatlantic heather? do we care? avoid this film at all cost. if you do wish to see an imax feature, i suggest the beautifully photographed india kingdom of the tiger or the technically thrilling space station 3d. trust me.",0,1110,185

"it was meant to be a parody on the lotrtrilogy. but this was one of the most awful movies ive ever seen. bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. this is my personal opinion. i dont doubt any second that there are people wholl like this sense of humor, but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as mel brooks or the zucker brothers. im working in a movie theater and in dvd shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas at the movies it was a nice but no big at all success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast. in dvd sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore. in the last ten years, the two worst movies ive seen are the ring thing and torque. i cant decide which one was worse, but im happy that there a so many good movies so i dont have to think too much on this question.",0,943,186

"i just got the uk 4disc special edition of superman 1 for about 5. the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the molemen. so i slapped it into the dvd player last night, and here are my findings.br br some initial disappointment i hadnt checked, and i think i had it mentally tagged as one of the kirk alyn serials. im not a huge fan of george reeves as superman, and i hadnt seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk alyn but hey ho, never mind.br br this black and white production runs for less than an hour. it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of reeves early tv series, a twoparter, put together for cinema release, although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series. in any event, its an odd choice for reasons ill get to later. im of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. even so, for a low budget movie, this one is really low budget.br br the story concerns the small town of silsby population 1,430 which, puzzlingly, is also home to the worlds deepest oil well 6 miles. the story opens with the wells foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis reporters kent and lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. as clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow emerge from the cappedoff drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.br br a deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. the little guys scare some kids, so jeff corey playing the towns rampant xenophobe incites some pals to kill these creatures. superman steps in moderately ineffectually and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. coreys pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. corey incites a lynch mob despite the sheriff arresting him to hang the hospitalised moleman. superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. a total of 4 molemen emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey i call this an aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go aargh! and superman saves him. he immediately changes his ways because of amazement at superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the molemen go back down the shaft. the end.br br despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing i have left out all the moleman 1 creeps from a to b, looking out to make sure noone is following him stuff. the molemen are never engaged in any way whatsoever they have no dialogue they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. they do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bugeyed monsters that the towns reaction implies.br br reeves is quite a good clark kent very much a hardnosed reporter, much more so than phyllis coates rather indifferent lois lane. but he is a terrible, terrible superman. not only does he not look the part at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the tv episodes, the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. im sure he was told to strike the pose which superman does constantly, but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. and he plays superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher he doesnt actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.br br and superman does a huge amount of walking around i say a huge amount he isnt actually in it all that much, and a bit of running. he takes off and lands a couple of times, but isnt seen in flight at any point. oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. in fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present arent very good.br br ive tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time but even by those standards i think its a pretty threadbare effort. thankfully, production standards on the tv series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.br br something of a disappointment i shant be watching it again.",0,4634,860

"but cinderella gets my vote, not only for the worst of disneys princess movies, but for the worst movie the company made during walts lifetime. the music is genuinely pretty, and the story deserves to be called classic. what fails in this movie are the characters, particularly the title character, who could only be called the heroine in the loosest sense of the term.br br after a brief prologue, the audience is introduced to cinderella. she is waking up in the morning and singing a dream is a wish your heart makes. this establishes her as an idealist and thus deserving of our sympathy. unfortunately, the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about. freedom from her servant role? the respect of her stepfamily? someone to talk to besides mice and birds? in one song cut from the movie but presented in the special features section of the latest dvd cinderella relates her wish that there could be many of her so she could do her work more efficiently. you go girlfriend! in short, cinderella is a very bland character. she passively accepts her stepfamilys abuse, escaping into her unspoken dreams for relief. she only asserts herself once by reminding her stepmother that she is still a member of the family. for this, she is given permission to go the ball if she completes her housework and finds something to wear, a token gesture that is clearly absurd to everyone except, of course, cinderella. can anyone see belle or jasmine being such a doormat? if cinderella is dull, her male counterpart is nothing short of lifeless. the prince in cinderella gets no dialog and almost no screen time. we are given no indication if he is a good man, if he respects cinderella or anything. all we know is 1 he is a prince and 2 he dances well. heck, even the prince from snow white got to sing a romantic song at least. not only does this lack of development make the romance less interesting, it makes cinderella look like either a social climber or an idiot, weakening her already tenuous appeal.br br perhaps realizing how dull the main characters were, the animators chose to give excessive screen time to the movies comic relief, cinderellas friends, the mice. granted, these characters are amusing. even so, when the comic relief steals the show from the principals, well, lets just say your story has some problems.br br dinsey loves to proclaim all its animated features as masterpieces. while many of them are, there are some that do not deserve this appellate in any way. cinderella is a prime example of this fact.",0,2539,445
"seriously what were they thinking? over the course of years the columbo series has tried out some new things and diverted away from the usual successful formula but this movie really overdoes it. this movie is basically very different from any other columbo movie but the differences are not for the good of the movie.br br main thing that of course makes this movie different from any other columbo movie is the fact that there is no murder being committed. the entire premise of this movie is totally different and it places the columbo character in a totally different environment and situation. also the overall is just totally different and more modernized.br br director alan j. levi did some other columbo movies in the past, which all very much sticked to the usual formula. it also makes it an odd choice that he got picked to direct this movie.br br the columbo character himself also feels quite different, perhaps because of the reason that he gets placed in a totally different environment and situation, when he helps out his nephew after his bride disappeared right after the wedding. the absence of some good relieving and trademark columbo humor also doesnt exactly make this a good or enjoyable watch.br br in all honesty, the movie doesnt begin too bad but the movie starts to become more and more ridicules with its story as it progresses. its such a stupid written kidnapthriller with a story that starts to become more and more unlikely. it also makes the movie more and more unwatchable. this is a very little interesting columbo entry that also really doesnt know to entertain its viewers in any way.br br it also doesnt help much that the supporting actors arent the most talented ones around. despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style, peter falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie. can you just imaging how this movie would had been without him? it would had been an extremely bad and ridicules cheap movie i can tell you.br br an odd columbo entry, which could be described as a failed experiment to divert from the usual formula.br br 410",0,2199,383

"around the late 1970s, animator don bluth, frustrated with the output his company, disney was churning, defected from the mouse house to form his own studio. his first production, the secret of nimh, was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day. this was followed by an american tail and the land before time, both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful. although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh, they still are very charming, enjoyable features for both children and grownups. but before long, don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film, and matters werent helped by the fact that it opened alongside disneys the little mermaid.br br considering that the movie has such a friendlysounding title, one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare. instead bluth provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling, deceit, crime, mistreatment, and murder. that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say, but it does call into question over whether the film is for children. on the other hand, its hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven. in short, its a movie with a major identity crisis.br br set in a dreary junkyard of new orleans, the movie starts out when charlie b. barkin, a roughandtumble german shepherd, is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner, a nasty, cigarpuffing pitbull, carface. before you know it, charlie finds himself in heaven, albeit by default. here a whippet angel, annabelle, tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people, dogs are usually loyal and kind. this line represents the confused nature of the movie, since the dogs in the movie, the whippet aside, are presented as anything but.br br upon realizing that hes been murdered, charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface. with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy, charlie rescues carfaces prize, annemarie, a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races. charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her a family, but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down. although he refuses to admit it, charlie does grow to love annemarie...br br the concept of the story isnt as problematic as the execution. aside from the human girl annemarie and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about threequarters through with the vocal pipes of ken page, none of the other characters emerge as likable, nor frankly, are even worth caring about. unfortunately, that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an antihero, the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable. as such, the audience feels no empathy for charlie, and worse, his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing. further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds. besides the lack of an endearing lead, the movies other problem is in the structure of the story. the slowlypaced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movies running time. the aforementioned musical alligator who resides in a danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere, as does a scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding a pack of pastelcolored pups pizza. the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft a bit more polish could have made this a tighter, impactful story.br br matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and t.j. kuenster annemaries song and the gators ballad are the only good ones the latter in particular benefits from ken pages mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast. as mentioned, burt reynolds stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end. dom deluise as itchy is pretty good, but hes had better roles, notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh. ken page, as mentioned, is awesome in anything he does, but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best. similarly wasted are loni anderson as a collie who once sired a litter with charlie, melba moore, and charles nelson reilly. judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable, partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show.br br barsi aside, the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation. technically, this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluths team by 1980s standards, that is, particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a gargantuan satanic caninedemon. if anything, the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling.br br on the whole, however, i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment. even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and a moving conclusion, the overall package is not in the same league as bluths better efforts. animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry, but by the time its over, all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth.",0,5745,987
"i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but i just got back from this movie, and felt i had to express my opinions. let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan. but what makes a horror movie? i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. i know they often lack in horror movies, but prom night looked like it didnt even put forth any effort in that department. next, we all love suspense. that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. yeah, prom night had none of that! of course, we like a terrifying killer. prom night have that? nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil knife. and when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated pg13 like prom night, they leave that stuff out too. so with all of these elements missing, i ask....does this still count as a horror movie? nope. id call it more of a comedy. people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw semipro that was supposed to actually be a comedy which also sucked, but thats another story!. i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror. all the good horror movies of the good ol days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. the people i went to see it with didnt even know this was a remake! which made me mad! i wonder what will happen when theres no more movies to remake??? where will horror go next???",0,1536,297

"please note i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film. i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky. considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing, my review must be read with this in mind.br br although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well, this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929, up through the early to almost the mid30s, a lot of famous french films were essentially silent filmswith some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film. the lip movements in many, and in particular this film, dont even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms. brooks could do a french film. this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent filmand as a silent film this is would have been an average filmwith excellent camera work at times and some decent silentstyle acting.br br the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. for a silent morality play circa 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary that means oldnot slutty. a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fianc cant handle it. she gives it all up, temporarily, but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! a tad melodramatic, huh? and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.br br finally, the character of the fiancs friend? i found very disturbing and unreal. he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received meanspirited. were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? this seems to me thats what is implied and i dont like it at all.br br there are far better french films of the era le million, la femme du boulanger, fanny, regain, and others as well as better silent films. i just cant understand this films high rating.",0,2249,408
"the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one, that is aside from the musical perspective. it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror. had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film, however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers dont exactly sit well next to the songs. br br aside from the poor premise the acting isnt the best either, goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast. overall a disappointment.br br 310",0,781,135
"i cannot stay indifferent to lars van triers films. i consider breaking the waves nothing less than a masterpiece. i loved dancer in the night. i admired the idea in dogville but the overall exercise looked to me too dry and too theatrical, less cinema. europa which i see only now was a famous film at its time, succeeded in the us the relative success of an european film and got the oscar for the best foreign language movie, but did not survive well the time in my opinion. it is also a too much explicit and extrovert exercise in cinema art to my taste.br br the story has a level of ambiguity that cannot escape the viewer. treating the period that immediately followed the second world war not in the black and white colors of victors and vanquished, of executioners and victims but as rather ambiguous times when people of both sides were fighting for survival in the aftermath of a catastrophic event that change the lives of nations and individuals forever is still a source of disputes even today, more such was novel and courageous two decades ago. yet it is the means of expression that really do not appear fit to the task.br br the film seems to include a lot of quotes descending directly from the films of hitchcock, especially his early films set in the prewar europe, with brave british spies fighting evil german spies on trains crossing at high speed the continent at dark. the trains were a symbol of the world and its conflicts with all their intensity and dramatism. here the train also becomes the symbol of the first sparkles of the rebirth of germany after war, of its might, of its obsession with order and regulation, of punctuality and civility. the characters that populate the train are far from being the classical spy stories good or bad guys. the principal character a young american of german origin coming to postwar europe willing to be part of a process of help and reconciliation finds himself in an ambiguous world of destruction and corruption, with liberators looking more like oppressive occupiers, with the vanquished not resigned to their fate but rather willing to continue on the path of selfdestruction, with love doubtfully mixed with treason.br br it is yet this classical film treatment that betrays the director in this case. the actions of the characters, especially of leopold kessler played by jeanmarc barr seem confused, and lack credibility. the overall cinematography seems to be not hitchcocklike but rather from a bad imitation of hitchcock in the late 30s. the usage of color over the blackandwhite film used in the majority of the time in moments of emotional intensity is also too demonstrative. it is not that van trier does not master his artistic means, but he is too demonstrative, he seems to try too hard to show what a great filmmaker he is. he really is great, as he will show in some of his later films, but it will be left to the viewers to decide this alone.",0,2934,516
"i caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel, and was reminded of how terrible i thought it was in 1980 when first released. many reviewers out there arent old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between stanley kubrick and steven king. the enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed master director put this multilayered supernatural story on the screen. salems lot had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a tv miniseries, directed by tobe hooper he of texas chainsaw massacre fame and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a chiller theatre vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. fans hoped that a director of kubricks stature would succeed where hooper had failed. it didnt happen.br br sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, its all downhill. jack nicholson cannot be anything but jack nicholson. hes always crazy and didnt bring anything to his role here. i dont care that many reviewers here think hes all that in this clinker, the heres johnny! bit notwithstanding...hes just awful in this movie. so is everyone else, for that matter. scatman crothers character, dick halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest shock sequences ever put on film. i remember the audience in the theater i saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. kings books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically. kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately dont really care what happens to whom.br br this movie still stinks and why so many think its a horror masterpiece is beyond me.",0,2017,346

"new york, i love you, or rather shouldbetitled manhattan, i love looking at your people in sometimes love, is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation. case in point, look at two of the segments in the film, one where ethan hawke lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexytalk, and another with orlando bloom trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two dostoyevsky books. while the latter isnt a great story by any stretch, its at least something that has a beginning, middle and end, as the composer tries to score, gets dostoyevky dumped in his lap, and in the end gets some help and maybe something more from a girl hes been talking to as a liaison between him and the director. the ethan hawke scene, however, is like nothing, and feels like it, like a fluke added in or directed by a filmmaker phoning it in or, for that matter, hawke with a combo of before sunrise and reality bites.br br whats irksome about the film overall is seeing the few stories that do work really well go up against the one or two possible stories and then the rest of the situations that unfold that are made to connect or overlap with one another i.e. bits involving bradley cooper, drea dematteo, hayden christensen, andy garcia, james caan, natalie portman, etc. its not even so much that the film set practically always in manhattan and not the new york of queens or staten island or the bronx not even, say, harlem or washington heights lacks a good deal of diversity, since there is some. its the lack of imagination that one found in spades, for better or worse, in paris jtaime. its mostly got little to do with new york, except for passing references, and at its worst the julie christieshia labeouf segment its incomprehensible on a level that is appalling.br br so, basically, wait for tv, and do your best to dip in and out of the film in, that is, for three scenes the aforementioned bloomchristina ricci segment which is charming the brett ratner directed segment yes, xmen 3 brett ratner with a very funny story of a teen taking a girl in a wheelchair to the prom only to come upon a great big twist and eli wallach and cloris leachman as an adorable quite old couple walking along in brooklyn on their 67th wedding anniversary. everything else can be missed, even natalie portmans directorial debut, and the return of a hughes brother only one, allan to the screen. a mixed bag is putting it lightly its like having to search through a bag of mixed nuts full of crappy peanuts to find the few almonds left.",0,2632,477

"spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? nobody should love that. lucius shepardbr br the color purple takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s, and tells the story of celie and nettie, two african american sisters. the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. this motif innocence interrupted by men permeates the entire film.br br the film then launches into a series of short sequences. celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson, a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly, forcing her to cook, clean and look after his children.br br all these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are instead surrounded by moments of pixiedust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work. the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that the color purple made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. ten minutes? he lasted a long time.br br the film is often said to deal which racism, sexism and black culture, but this is not true. alice walker, the author of the novel upon which the film is based, claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian. her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and selfdiscovery, which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women. for walker, the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.br br spielbergs film, however, reframes walkers story through the lens of comforting american mythologies. this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool. a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins, stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs. br br this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions. a film in which black people are oversexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible albert lives in a huge house and black men are completely inept. this is not the old south, this is the old south as derived from gone with the wind, mgm muscals, song of the south, warner cartoons, halleluha! and banned disney movies. in other words, its the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv. its all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy.br br of course, in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed. this reconciliation was in walkers novel, but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin.br br beyond walkers hate letter to black men and spielbergs bizarre caricaturing of black life, we are shown nothing of the black community. we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community. instead, spielbergs camera jumps about, desperately fighting for our attention one of celies kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a home alone movie, every emotion over played, the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by. couple this with quincy jones ridiculously white music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith, scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams.br br problematic too is the lack of white characters. consider this the men in this film arent portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood. no, they are cruel by nature. and the women, whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them. a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors, women unable to support themselves and their children alone.br br and so theres a hidden ideology at work here. late in the film one character tells another that since he didnt respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites. the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them. ie respect one another in your poor minority community and you wont run afoul of the dominant white culture. br br 310 a failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, emphatic music cues, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering the color purple worthless.",0,5909,995

"having loved paris, je taime, i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations, but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.br br although, i was not expecting a remake of paris in new york i was expecting the same structure. what i liked about paris was the breakup of the neighborhoods. you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell. in ny, there is no clear separation of the stories, at different points in the film, characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on. also, the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow.br br another thing i loved about the paris film was the different takes on love. it wasnt all romantic. there was love between parents and their children, unrequited love, a lonely, middleaged woman yearning for love etc., it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans. ny seemed to only go for an edgy, overthetop sexuality. there were some redeemable shorts the older couple having spent a lifetime together, julie christies short, but overall theny film didnt evoke any emotion for me. i didnt connect with any of the characters like i did with paris. i remember watching paris and feeling a deep sadness, loneliness, yearning, hopefulness, wonder... it just had so much soul. for me, there was no soul in the ny film.br br maybe if i had gone into it without having paris looming in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have elicited a more favorable response, but as a selftitled retake of paris, je taime i was sorely disappointed.",0,1673,297

"those of you who, like me, were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn, the fear will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel. it sort of follows a similar plot, but it is impossible to connect to the original, with the exception of the presence of morty, the mannequin monster made of wood. here is a brief overview.br br twenty years after mike hawthorne gordon currie, in a decent performance witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life, mike is still suffering from the fear of that day. in hopes of ridding his fear, mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents home. his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears, and then present the fears to the mannequin morty. according to an indian friend, this process is supposed to magically take away ones fear. what mike doesnt know is that morty is possessed with his fathers spirit, and begins killing off the friends...or is it really mike himself doing the killings? who cares?br br a have a few troubles with this film. the first lies with morty. i thought the original made morty look rather convincing. this time, it is painfully obvious morty is a man actor jon fedele in a fake looking suit. this can especially be seen in early scenes, where morty is still supposed to be inanimate, but if you watch closely you can see him blinking. another trouble is that most of the characters dont try hard enough. some of them do, namely betsy palmer, of friday the 13th fame, who was excellent in this film. but most of them dont make the effort or werent given the chance. finally, there are the killings. the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing. actually, when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie. when the second half of the movie arrives, and the killings really start, everything falls to pieces. deaths are either uncreative, unseen, or foreseen glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout. one character dies in the end and no one, including the viewer, even notices. while more characterization was needed in the beginning half, it wasnt too bad. the second half was. i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didnt know how to shoot the violent scenes, so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian. a silly ending doesnt help either. thus, unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin, you should probably skip the fear 2 halloween night. zanatos score 4 out of 10.",0,2550,453

"are you familiar with concept of childrens artwork? while it is not the greatest picasso any threeyearold has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. if painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. you will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. well, this concept of childrens artwork is how i felt about fuquas depressingly cheap and uncreative film bait. while on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see fuquas style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. if you have seen either training day or king arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film bait. while foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why fuquas name appears on so many best of film lists.br br i will never disagree with someone that fuquas eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. his ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. i am surprised that more of hollywood hasnt jumped aboard this bandwagon. even in the silly feature bait, you are witness to fuquas greatness. two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. in both of these scenes i saw the director fuqua at work. alas, in the rest of this film, all i saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. the likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in hollywood. we have seen this two often, and no matter who you are unless you are charlie kaufmann, you cannot recreate the wheel. it is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with bait. i was annoyed with fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. i was just tired of the structure, and while i hoped that fuqua would redefine it, he did not.br br then, there was the acting. while jamie foxx has never impressed me as an actor, i was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. i wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to collateral. i was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that foxx could handle the role in collateral. again, i was disappointed. foxx was annoying. not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither fuqua nor foxx took the time to fully train foxx on what should be adlibed and what should be used to further the plot. instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of foxx just trying to make the audience laugh. adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. fuqua should have stopped this immediately. foxxs jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. instead of character development, he would crack a joke. neither style worked, no joke was funny. the rest of the cast was average. by this i mean i have seen them all in similar roles. they were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. they were pawns filling in dead air space. fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.br br overall, this was a sad film. with no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. in each scene i saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. are my words harsh? i dont think so. when you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. bait contained none of these. while i will give fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. apparently, i took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully i can stop others from taking that curious nibble.br br grade out of for his two scenes that were fun to watch",0,4761,861

"after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie, i knew what was supposed to happen. i had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. i have a couple main points for not liking this movie.br br spoilers br br 1. the casting. jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrences character. also, i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy. i pictured wendy much differently. i can see why they picked jack nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but hes not supposed to really look evil. hes supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. also, they make one of the worst movie couples. danny was alright, he needed more life though. he acted way to droney.br br 2. the screenplay. they cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! i was extremely irritated.br br 3. the ending. the ending was changed completly, halorann died, jack froze to death, wendy never got hurt...the overlook didnt blow up. the ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, i was apalled. hallorann was never supposed to die, but jack killed him with an ax. if they wanted to kill him, at least have jack use a roque mallet. you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.br br there are other things that i didnt like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. the camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator didnt happen in the book was cool, but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didnt go with the book, to try to be scared at all. i reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more. i would never have done that, i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day. i cant wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.br br rating 210",0,2300,439

"this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of hamlet to ever reach the screen. branaghs approach to the material can only be described as vulgar going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket, having fortinbras army appear suddenly on the horizon looking very much like the climax of monty python and the holy grail when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco who shouts the very unshakespearean cry of ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack before being gunned down, and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagneys bottom and mary pickfords kate.br br branagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. and branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and olphelias relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.br br the uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime more footage of kenneth branagh. this is never so apparent as in the how all occasions inform against me speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film at least thats how it feels, which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the winds ill never be hungry again. this may serve branaghs ego, but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech when i saw the film in the theater, i leaned over to my companion and snickered great moments with mr. hamlet. branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to outdo the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. branaghs dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius heart with a super heros bulls eye. the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so offthewall funny.br br while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a starstudded display of a oncetalented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. the emperor has no clothes, and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one mans ego out of control.",0,2573,446

"the story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies. richard is great. he really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. seriously, i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile. i cant say anything bad about peter galleghar. hes one of my favorite actors. i love anne rice. im currently reading the vampire chronicles, but im glad i saw the movie before reading the book. this is a little tooreal for me. i prefer lestat and louiss witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. sorry for the ambiguity, but i dont want to give anything away sorry, but its just not my type of show.",0,846,159
"in 1955, tobias schneerbaum disappeared in the peruvian amazon. one year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. it took him 45 years to go back. supposedly, keep the river on your right is a modern cannibal tale. in reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. the first half of the movie is more like a travel log of new ginuea, mostly touting the native art. the second half relies on still photos of a peruvian cannibal tribe, but really thats about it. unless of course, you are interested in home movies of a jewish wedding, or schneerbaum introducing his former male lovers. i give up. big disappointment and not really a modern cannibal tale. merk",0,699,121
"this review may contain some spoilers.br br just when you thought they didnt make them so extremely bad anymore, along comes rae dawn chong as a space vixen and willie nelson as a native american witchdoctor! its even worse when you factor in that these two are the better aspects of starlight, a film that should only be viewed for laughs.br br chong is an alien sent to earth to seek out the only remaining halfbreed, part man and part alien. apparently, the earth is in dire straits. something is wrong with the genetics of mankind, and in a few decades the world will be turned into a polluted wasteland. only by duplicating the dna of the halfbreed can the kindly alien race save the planet. dont ask me how that is, since the movie gives the impression that the world will be destroyed by pollution, which is caused by humans. you would think earth could only be saved by getting rid of the polluting creatures, not saving them! anyway, the halfbreed turns out to be billy wirth, a man living in a small southwestern town and is part native american from his mothers line, despite the fact that his mother is a redheaded caucasian and his grandfather is willie nelson. wasnt this the sort of malarkey that made the bombastic carmen electra bomb the chosen one such a howler? chong arrives in her ship just as wirth nearly drowns after driving his motorcycle into a lake in a fit of recklessness being the result of just breaking up with his girlfriend. before you can say utter the word hogwash, chong is revealing her secret to wirth, who isnt surprised for a moment, and spreading the word to wirths family. chong also makes pals with wirths mother, who seems to have lost a few of her marbles over the years. well, this is because wirths father was an alien that abandoned her. of course, he is the standard rogue alien that has conveniently picked this moment to come to earth for wirth so he can use wirths dna to make the people of earth his slaves. huh? his laughable attempts to use his telepathic powers and capture wirth suck up most of the screen time and are the worst scenes in the movie. not only are they boring, but they are the scenes where you will be spotting the flubs the most.br br the ideas might be nice on paper, but they are handled here with the utmost of stupidity, particularly in the aforementioned scenes with the rogue alien. but the effects are the bane of the movie. the opening scene involves chong on her spaceship, communicating with her superior, someone who we do not see but that chong communicates with through a vat that emits pink light. they use no spoken words, but telepathy, so we are treated to subtitles. trouble is, both chong and her superiors subtitles both look alike, and the director gives you no indication as to which of the two are actually speaking at any given moment, which makes the whole conversation nothing but gibberish. the spaceship is the worst effect to come out of hollywood this side of an ed wood film. now, i am usually lenient on effects when dealing with a low budgeted film such as this, but these effects really got to me. the most offensive was the most simple one a fake night sky. the stars in the sky are so phony they almost sound off a dial tone. most notably are the moments where chong tells someone she comes from pleiades, and we get a shot of the seven stars. thing is, the seven stars take up about half the night sky in the movie, but any stargazer knows that pleiades is a star cluster between the constellations perseus and taurus, and the cluster doesnt take up much room in the sky at all. these effects just get so lousy that your jaw will hang lower and lower with every passing moment. be careful, for it will go right through the floor during the finale when the effects have willie nelson turn into a human spotlight and . . . oh, it has to be seen to be believed!br br starlight, star bright last star i see tonight i wish i might, i wish i may not have to watch any more of this trash today.br br zantaras score 1 out of 10.",0,4032,744
"already his first claim, that desires are always artificial, is totally fallacious.br br when a jehovah witness reject gets his own documentary on movies or anything for that matter its time for anyone to get their own. although far, far more intelligent than, say, paris hilton i know, not too difficult zizeks mouth spews just as much baloney as hers, just a different kind. he combines the worst from both his professional worlds psychoanalysis and philosophy. both fields are notorious for conveniently offering the expert bllsosopher plenty of leeway to create unprovable theories, to rant without a beginning or end, and to connect concepts almost randomly, in the process misusing the english language by creating a semantic jumble only a mother can love. example there are three main marx brothers hence what a great idea to connect them with three levels of human consciousness, the id, the ego and the superego. im kind of surprised he didnt play a clip from snowhite and make an analogy between the seven dwarfs and the seven levels of gahannah moslem hell. its like the premise of schumachers the number 23 play with numbers long enough, and you can come up with any kind of cockamamie theory you want, even linking ancient greeks with princess dis death.br br however, there is an entertainment element to tpgtc watching a raving lunatic sweat like a hog while uttering delusional chants masked as intellectual analysis can be quite a lot of fun. why watch cuckoos nest or any other madhouse drama when you can have zizek for more than 2 hours? its like watching an amusing train wreck. admittedly, he is almost funny on one or two occasions.br br i have always been mystified by people who desperately try to elevate moviemaking into an exalted intellectual social science. giving idiotic movies like birds this much thought, hence this much credit, probably has its fat creator laughing in his grave. the raw truth is that the vast majority of movies have zero intellectual value, and the few ones that do have some intelligence dont require a shrinkturnedphilosopher to draw one a map to understand them unless one is a complete idiot. zizek sees layers and layers of meaning in the most banal movies. hallucinogenic drugs must be rather popular and cheap in slovenia these days...br br when zizek showed the bathtub hole in the psycho shower scene, i thought he was going to say something about galactic black holes how they drain the life out of stars just as the bathtub hole sucks in janet leighs blood. or perhaps he could have said how the hole represents leighs vagina, with the blood flowing into it instead of out as in menstruation, this representing some kind of clever zizekian irony. speaking of which, the real irony is that if hitchcock had really put that much thought into every scene and the script, his movies wouldnt have been the illogical, farfetched crap that they often are. the point of these bathtub hole analogies was to show just how easy it is to improvise about hidden, deep meanings. and when you add zizeks fanciful terminology from philosophy and psychology, layering these terms on top of these analogies like wedding cake decorations, you get a rambling jumble that can instantly impress the uneducated i.e. the easily impressionable and the gullible.br br zizek utters a number of unintentionally funny things here, one of the most absurd ideas being when he associates anthony perkinss cleaning of the bloodied bathroom with the satisfaction of work, of a job well done. dont laugh... neither hitchcock nor the writer of psycho could have ever even vaguely entertained this notion that perkins might be enjoying a job well done the cleaning of a bloodstained toilet while they were conceivingdirecting that scene. talk about putting words into ones dead mouth, but in the context of misinterpreting what the director had to say.br br i like zizeks initial thoughts on tarkovskys terrific solaris, but then he has to ruin a rare good impression by dragging in antifeminism and other nonsense into his theory.br br zizeks attitude towards logic is that of a dog toward its plastic bone. i just want to play with it all day! logic has its rules, and is not supposed to be raped at least not publicly by the likes of him. he seems to regard logic, proof, commonsense, and reason as enemies or mere throwaway toys concepts to be either avoided, twisted to fit the endgoal, or simply annihilated. zizek is the lsdtripped hippie, and all his favorite movies are his own personal 2001s.br br the fact that zizek overfocuses on two of the most overrated directors and ones whose films often lack intelligence, if anything such as hitchcock and lynch, only further diminishes his already low credibility. i was surprised de palma didnt feature more prominently thats another lame director who writes inept scripts. zizek has a field day with lynchs incomprehensible lost highway. there are just as many interpretations of that movie as there are people who watched it.br br zizeks comment that the viewer readily accepts von triers laughable, groundbreaking physical setup in dogville made me snicker. br br however, zizek doesnt only make up stuff as he goes along, he also indulges heavily in the bleedin obvious. like all social scientists an oxymoron, he wraps his very trite observations into articulate if full of spitting and sometimes complex blankets of language. after all, sociology functions in precisely the same way it makes us believe we are hearing something new when in fact its what we already all know, but told in an eloquent way which fools the more unobservant listener.br br i was halfexpecting for men in white suits to suddenly appear out of nowhere and strap him up in a looniesuit...br br slavoj zizek soon as a stalker in a kids park near you.br br httprateyourmusic.comlistfedor8150worstcasesofnepotism",0,5874,986
"here be spoilers br br recap mia helin is returning home from capital stockholm to rural rttvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday. she is by far the youngest child, and has two sisters eivor ernst and gunilla petrn. eivor has a family and still lives in rttvik and gunilla has divorced and moved a town away. mia is still single and is focused on her career. there are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle. as the party goes on and alcohol consumed, more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise...br br comments to be the work of a new writerdirector it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedydramas has been following for years. there are really no new elements or ideas. this movie draws upon three basic areas. 1 embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves. 2 sorrow and 3 anxiety. this move has the focus on the last one, almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along. no loss though, since the humor that is there is not funny. the performances from the cast are good i guess, though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten. i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences, but there were none. to conclude, there are better ways to spend ones time than watching this.br br 310",0,1476,265
"for some reason, various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first. james gregory lee kenyon enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of tyranus when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead demonicus back to life. this shotondigital full moon release is stupid, senseless, has terrible acting and sound and the los angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy. however, its pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance. whether bugeyed running around in cheaplooking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection, kenyons ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed. oh well, at least hes not boring like most of the rest of the cast.",0,1069,179
